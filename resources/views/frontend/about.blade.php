                In a world that demands increasing collaboration within the scientific community, 
                solid Earth science laboratories are challenged with finding each other to exchange best practices and re-use data. 
                Data produced by the various laboratories are crucial to serving societyâ€™s needs for geo-resources exploration and for protection against geo-hazards. 
                Indeed, to model resource formation and system behaviour during exploitation, we need an understanding from the molecular to the continental scale, based on experimental and analytical data.
                    Therefore, coordination and communication inside the European solid Earth science laboratories, 
                complemented with services to increase curation and access for re-use of laboratory data is needed to effectively contribute to solve the grand challenges facing society.

                The <a class="link" href="https://www.epos-eu.org/tcs/multi-scale-laboratories">EPOS Multi-Scale Laboratories (MSL)</a> community includes a wide range of world-class laboratories. 
                The length scales addressed by these infrastructures cover the nano- and micrometre levels (electron microscopy and micro-beam analysis) 
                to the scale of experiments on centimetre and decimetre sized samples, to analogue model experiments simulating the reservoir scale, the basin scale and the plate scale.

                EPOS MSL collects and harmonizes available and emerging laboratory (meta)data on the properties and processes controlling rock system behaviour at scales ranging from nm to km to global. 
                The aim is to generate data products that are easily findable, accessible and interoperable for future research, notably into Geo-resources, Geo-storage, Geo-hazards 
                and Earth System Evolution. Data emerging from MSL labs can be categorized as below, following the six major sub-domains in MSL:
