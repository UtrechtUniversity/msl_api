            </h2>
            <p>The goal of EPOS is to establish a comprehensive multidisciplinary research platform for the Earth sciences in Europe. It aims to facilitate the integrated use of data, models, and laboratories, from both existing and new pan-European Research Infrastructures, allowing open access and transparent use of data. To reach this goal EPOS is thematically subdivided in 10 different communities (TCSs), one of them being the Multi-scale laboratories (MSL).
            </p>
            <p>
              The TCS MSL research infrastructures and the data that they generate, are currently grouped into 6 subdomains:

            <h2 class="pt-10 pb-4">How does your laboratory benefit from EPOS MSL?
            </h2>
            <p>By becoming part of our network, your lab is offered a platform to showcase its research data output (example), facility equipment and information, and, the opportunity to present your lab as accessible to potential visitors. </p>
            
            
            <h2 class="pt-10 pb-4">Whatâ€™s in it for the researchers?</h2>
            <p>
              Researchers are increasingly asked to publish their research data (incl. a DOI), for example when publishing a research article. While a publication makes data openly accessible by others in principle, in practice data are available fragmented across Europe and difficult to find. EPOS MSL provides tools and assistance in making published MSL data centrally discoverable in the MSL and EPOS data portals. This makes the research data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) and citable for other scientists. Furthermore, it increases the citation index and ensures that researchers are compliant with the (increasingly more common) requirement by funders and publication agencies to publish data in an open and FAIR manner. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="pt-10 pb-4">What do we expect from you?</h2>
            <p>A healthy research community requires active engagement of its partners. 
              As an EPOS MSL laboratory you:

            <div class="flex place-content-center ">
              <ul class="list-disc list-outside w-3/4">
                <li class="p-1">Are engaged in at least one of the subdomains within MSL (see above)</li>
                <li class="p-1">Publish research data in a FAIR manner, at a reputable data repository. In doing so, you use MSL vocabulary terms in assigning metadata/keywords. </li>
                <li class="p-1">Pro-actively let us know which repository you use, when publishing data.</li>
                <li class="p-1">Share laboratory information (location, equipment, contact details) with us, for hosting on the EPOS portal.</li>
                <li class="p-1">Are strongly encouraged to take part in community initiatives. These can relate, for example,  to improving FAIR data practices and tools, funding proposals or lab accessibility. Most of the community initiatives are online (video meetings), but occasionally take place in person (e.g. at EGU, EPOS days, or other). </li>
                <li class="p-1">Are a pro-active ambassador for EPOS MSL within your community.     </li>
