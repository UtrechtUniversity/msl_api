        "description": "Sub-samples from sediment cores collected from the Semenov Hydrothermal Field region of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during the RRS James Cook cruise JC224 (March - April 2022) were taken for geochronological analysis. Continuous U-channel sub-samples were prepared specifically for paleomagnetic analysis. This dataset includes measurements of inclination, declination, natural remanent magnetization (NRM), and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) from the JC224 sediment cores which can be used to calculate relative palaeointesity (RPI) to constrain the age of the sediments and construct an age-depth model. Paleomagnetic measurements were carried out at the Paleomagnetism and Environmental Magnetism Laboratory at the University of Southampton. The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded under NERC's Ultramafic-hosted mineral Resource Assessment (ULTRA) project, grant reference NE\/S004068\/1, and the sediment cores are currently stored at the British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility (BOSCORF) for long-term preservation.",

        "description": "The data comprise P-wave velocity and attenuation (1\/Q) measurements of water-saturated sand packs (four samples) across saturation levels, from dry to fully saturated. Using an acoustic pulse tube, measurements were recorded in the sonic frequency range (1-20 kHz, centred at 10 kHz) under 10 MPa effective pressure with atmospheric pore pressure. Data were collected in the Pulse Tube Laboratories at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Southampton, between March 2022 and January 2023, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC Grant NE\/J020753\/1), and primarily collected and analysed by Hanif Sutiyoso (University of Southampton). The experiment aimed to fill gaps in sonic frequency measurements of sediments across saturation states, providing a spectrum of water\/gas saturation rather than a single value. This dataset is valuable for researchers analysing saturated sediments and is directly comparable to sonic well-logging field data due to its frequency range. The full dataset has been published at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/1365-2478.13607.\nThe method involved measuring time series of signal amplitude from four samples (A to D) inside a 4.5 m water-filled acoustic pulse tube, which allows plane wave propagation in the sediment-jacketed samples. Time-domain data were transformed into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and deconvolved with the chirp source signal to obtain the impulse response. Nonlinear inversion was used to minimize an objective function derived from initial time-domain estimates, determining the sample's complex velocity and attenuation (1\/Q).",

        "description": "Twenty-six 10 cm3 samples from DSDP (Deep Sea Drilling Project) Site 94, Core 15, sections 3 and 4 were examined at 10 cm-intervals (417.84-415.01 meters below seafloor [mbsf]). The sedimentary material was soaked in distilled water and washed under running water through a 63 \u00b5m sieve and oven dried at <40 degrees C. Samples were then re-washed and dried using the same method. Foraminifera are abundant and recystallised. Calcite precipitation is observed on microspherules in some samples.\nFor each sample, a total of three foraminiferal species that correspond to different ecological habitats were selected for isotope analysis. Specimens of Pseudohastigerina micra and P. naguewichiensis were selected from the 125-250 \u00b5m size fraction and Turborotalia cocoaensis, and Cibicidoides eocaenus were selected from the >250 \u00b5m size fraction. Specimens that had infilling or showed heavy calcification were avoided. All foraminifera were ultrasonicated for 2 seconds prior to isotopic analyses.\nTo track the number of impact microspherules across the sampled interval, we performed our own microspherules count from the >125 micron size fraction. Microtektites have not been distinguished from microkrystites in this study and thus all recovered spherules should be considered under the broader category of microspherules (both microtektites and crystalline-bearing microkrystites). We recovered a total of 4999 microspherules from the 26 samples. Microspherules are usually <1 mm in size, and occur primarily spherical, although ellipsoid, teardrop and dumbbell forms and fragments have also been found. In most samples the microspherules count is low <50 microspherules. We found a high abundance (>50 microspherules\/10 cm3) between samples 15R\/3\/135-137 cm and 15R\/3\/89-91 cm (416.36 to 415.90 mbsf). Our peak concentration of microspherules at 15R\/3\/109-111 cm (416.10 mbsf), where 3395 microspherules were recovered, coincides with the younger of the two late Eocene impacts i.e., the North America microtektite horizon associated with the Chesapeake Bay impact.",

Soil dry bulk density, estimated soil porosity, soil moisture and soil moisture retention (to 100 cm suction) were determined through laboratory analysis of soil samples collected at five depths between the surface and 100 cm below ground level (where possible). Surface soil infiltration rates were measured, and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated at 25 cm and 45 cm depths (where possible).\nField scale point data were collected at seven sites in the Thames Catchment, with three sub-groups of sites under different land use and management practices. The first land management group included three arable fields in the Cotswolds, Gloucestershire, on shallow soils over Limestone with no grass in rotation, herbal leys in rotation or rye and clover in rotation. The second group included two arable fields in near Wantage, Oxfordshire, on free draining loamy soils over chalk with conventional management or controlled traffic. The final group included a permanent grassland and broadleaf woodland on slowly permeable soil over mudstone near Oxford, Oxfordshire. Data were collected in representative infield areas; trafficked areas (e.g. tramlines or animal tracks), and untrafficked margins.\nSamples and measurements were taken between April 2021 and October 2021, with repeats taken before and after harvest.\nSoil samples were collected using Eijkelkamp 07.53.SC sample ring kit with closed ring holder and the Edelman auger and Stony auger when required. Infiltration measurements were taken using Mini Disk Infiltrometers. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using Guelph permeameters. Soil bulk density and porosity were calculated using oven drying methods.

        "description": "This collection comprises two time-series of 3D in-situ synchrotron x-ray microtomography (\u03bcCT) volumes showing two Ailsa Craig micro-granite samples (ACfresh02 and ACHT01) undergoing triaxial deformation. These data were collected in-situ at the PSICHE beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron, Gif-sur-Yvette, France in December 2016 (standard proposal 20160434) and are fully explained in Cartwright-Taylor A., Main, I.G., Butler, I.B., Fusseis, F., Flynn M. and King, A. (in press), Catastrophic failure: how and when? Insights from 4D in-situ x-ray micro-tomography, J. Geophys. Res. Solid Earth.\n\nTogether, these two time-series show the influence of heterogeneity on the micro-crack network evolution. Ailsa Craig micro-granite is known for being virtually crack-free. One sample (ACfresh02) remained as-received from the quarry until it was deformed, while the second (ACHT01) was slowly heated to 600 degC and then slowly cooled prior to deformation in order to introduce material disorder in the form of a network of nano-scale thermal cracks. Thus these two samples represent two extreme end-members: (i) ACfresh02 with the lowest possible (to our knowledge) natural pre-existing crack density, and so is a relatively homogeneous sample and (ii) ACHT01 with a thermally-induced nano-crack network imprinted over the nominally crack-free microstructure, and therefore has increased heterogeneity relative to ACfresh02. \n\nEach 3D \u03bcCT volume shows the sub-region of each sample in which the majority of damage was located and has three parts. Part one is reconstructed 16-bit greyscale data. Part two is 8-bit binary data showing individual voids (pores and micro-cracks) in the dataset after segmentation. Part three is 32-bit data showing the local thickness of each void, as in Cartwright-Taylor et al. (in press) Figures 4 and 5. Each part is a zip file containing a sequence of 2D image files (.tif), sequentially numbered according to the depth (in pixels, parallel to the loading axis) at which it lies within the sample volume. File dimensions are in pixels (2D), with an edge length of 2.7 microns. Each zip file is labelled with the sample name, the relevant letter for each 3D volume as given in Cartwright-Taylor et al. (in press) Tables 3 and 4, part 1, 2 or 3 (depending whether the data are greyscale, binary or local thickness respectively), the differential stress (MPa) on the sample, and the associated ram pressure (bar) to link with individual file names. The following convention is used:\n\nsample_letter_part_differentialstress_rampressure_datatype.\n\nAlso included are (i) two spreadsheets (.xlsx), one for each sample, containing processing parameters and the mechanical stress and strain at which each volume was scanned, and (ii) zip files containing .csv files containing measurement data for the labelled voids in each volume. N.B. void label numbers are not consistent between volumes so they can only be used to obtain global statistics, not to track individual voids.",

Columns effluents were analysed periodically for key biogeochemical indicators (nitrate, sulfate) and trace metals (iron, manganese, uranium) and systems were sacrificed after 6 and 12 months of groundwater flow. Upon sacrifice, columns were cross-sectioned, and the sediment structure preserved for synchrotron micro-focus X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) mapping, and uranium L-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. Sub-samples of column sediments were also analysed for acid extractable metals, microbial abundance and classification and bioavailable Fe(II) concentrations.\nExperiments were performed between March 2016 and March 2017.

Grain size profiles of the cores have been obtained by analyzing wet sediments with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The OM content of the sediments was obtained by measuring the loss on ignition (LOI) of bulk sediments after calcination in a muffle furnace. The sediments have been analyzed for trace metal distribution using a Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (MP-AES). The grain size distribution has allowed to pinpoint the presence of flood couplets, characterized by coarse lags followed by fine grained materials. The trace metal distribution profiles have been compared with the flood couplets to assess the entity of metal mobilization during floods and subsequent droughts.",

The 2018 samples were collected during a large eruption of Kilauea volcano. The 2019 samples were collected during a period of very low volcanic activity. Samples were collected in several locations on the Island of Hawai'i, Hawaii, USA. Time-series samples were collected at -Leilani Estates -Volcano village -Pahala, Ocean View -Kailua-Kona -Mauna Loa Observatory in 2018 and 2019. Point-source samples were collected at the following locations -The main erupting vent 'Fissure 8' on the Kilauea Volcano in 2018, and repeated in its vicinity post-eruption in 2019 - The lava ocean entry point in 2018 and repeated in its vicinity post-eruption in 2019. The samples were collected using filter packs (FP) and Sioutas cascade impactors (SKC). The instruments were used at ground-level in all cases except for samples FP_08_1, FP_ 09_1, FP_09_2, SKC_08 and SKC_09 which were attached to an Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) in order to safely access the erupting vent and the lava ocean entry. The samples were then analysed using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ion chromatography (IC). Sample analysis was done at the University of Leeds, United Kingdom (2018 samples) and the University of Leeds and Open University, United Kingdom (2019 samples). The results are reported as concentration per volume of air sampled (\u00b5g\/m^3) to 2 significant figures. This was done to - assess the dispersion of major and trace elements in a volcanic plume, and quantify their depletion rates from the source into the far-field (up to ~240 km downwind) - assess the impact of volcanic emissions on the composition of the local atmosphere.

Geophysical and transport data were collected before, during and after exposing each sample to CO2, and analysed with basic petrophysical properties. \nThe tests were conducted in the high-pressure, room-temperature (20\u00b0C) experimental setup for multi-flow-through tests in the Rock Physics Laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS), during 2022, as part of the OASIS, EHMPRES and FOCUS projects with funding from the Research Council of Norway (RCN grant no. 280472 - OASIS) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC grants NE\/X003248\/1 - FAPESP-EHMPRES, and NE\/X006271\/1 - FOCUS). \nTo simulate the specific effective stress conditions of the target CO2 storage reservoir in Aurora (Aker et al., 2021), northern North Sea, the confining and pore pressure conditions of the reservoir were accommodated to our lab  temperature conditions. We measured ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and attenuations, axial strains and electrical resistivity for an increasing CO2 saturation. The degree of brine saturation was inferred from the electrical resistivity using the modified Archie\u2019s empirical relationship to account for the contribution of clay minerals, based on the Waxman\u2013Smits\u2013Juhasz model (see further details in, e.g., Falcon-Suarez et al. (2021)). We refer to Falcon-Suarez et al. (2020) for further information about the experimental rig and the CO2 injection protocol.",

Twenty right cylindrical samples of \u2018Comiso\u2019 limestone (Ragusa Formation; Sicily) were tested in triaxial compression at a range of confining pressures simulating depths of 290 m, 620 m, 1.2 km, and 2.0 km respectively, assuming an average density of the over-burden load of 2470 kg\/m3. Prior to strength test, each sample was either oven dried (ca. 12 hours at 85 \u00b0C followed by cooling in a desiccator for 1 hour) or water saturated (samples in distilled water under vacuum for 24 hours). A subset of these samples has also been thermally treated at 150, 300, 450 and 600oC to induce thermal cracking prior to the mechanical testing. All tests were conducted at 10-5 s-1 axial strain rate in assumed drained conditions when relevant, and at room temperature. For saturated tests, the initial loading was applied in two steps, first by increasing Pc hydrostatically (\u03c31=\u03c32=\u03c33) until the desired confining pressure was reached, and then introducing pore fluid pressure, as per the functionality of the experimental set-up.

For each experiment, time, axial force, axial displacement, axial stress, confining displacement, confining pressure, axial strain A and B, axial average strain, circumferential extensometer, circumferential strain, volumetric strain, internal temperature, and axial delta P were recorded. Triaxial testing was undertaken using the MTS 815 servo-controlled stiff frame inside a vessel capable of a confining pressure up to 140 MPa at the Rock Mechanics and Physics Laboratory, British Geological Survey, UK. The confining cell is fitted with external heater bands and utilizing utilizes cascade control from internal and external thermocouples (accurate to \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C). An initial axial pre-load of 2.3 kN was applied, to ensure a stable contact and alignment of the platens. The confining pressure vessel was then closed and filled with mineral oil confining fluid. The axial pre-load was maintained whilst the confining pressure was applied at 2 MPa\/min to 60 or 120 MPa; these values were chosen to approximately bracket the pressures at the up-dip limit of seismic nucleation, corresponding to 2 \u2013 4 km depth (Arroyo et al., 2014). At this point, whilst held in axial force and confining pressure control, the rig was heated at 2\u00b0C\/min to 60\u00b0C to approximate the average temperature conditions at the depth of the up-dip limit of seismic nucleation (Harris and Spinelli, 2010). The samples were then left for approximately 1 hour allowing thermal equilibrium to be reached throughout the confining fluid and the samples. Once stable, axial loading was initiated in constant axial strain rate control at a rate of 5.0 x 10-6 s-1 until macroscopic failure occurred or a significant amount of post peak-stress axial strain was recorded (between 2% and 5%). We note that one test was conducted at the higher temperature of T=120\u00b0C with a result within 2.5% of the strength at T=60\u00b0C (Table 1). As this is below the expected sample-to-sample variability, no further temperature studies were conducted. The axial load, axial load actuator displacement, axial stress (s1), differential stress (Q=s1 - s3), confining pressure Pc (= s2= s3), confining pressure actuator displacement, axial strain (eax), circumferential strain (ecirc) and temperature were monitored throughout at sampling frequencies of 1s and 0.5kN.

        "description": "The dataset contains data from a dual experiment conducted to study (i) the stress dependence of ultrasonic (elastic) waves and permeability of salt rocks, and (ii) the dissolution of an intact and a cracked halite samples using geophysical methods.\n\nThe tests were run in the high-pressure room-temperature (20\u00b0C) experimental setup for flow-through tests at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) (Falcon et al. 2016). The rig consists of a triaxial vessel equipped with (i) ultrasonic sensors that allow measuring P- and S-wave velocities and their attenuation factors using the pulse echo method (McCann and Sothcott, 1992), and (ii) two rigs of electrodes embedded into the rubber sleeve of the pressure vessel for collecting electrical resistivity data that can be used to build up an electrical tomography of the sample (North el al. 2013). The rig has automatic control of both confining and pore pressure (ISCO EX-100D system). For the operating conditions and in homogeneous samples, the bulk electrical resistivity error is <1% for bulk resistivities <100 \u03a9 m, increasing up to 5% with the degree of heterogeneity and above this resistivity value, at frequencies 1\u2013500 Hz (North et al., 2013). Regarding the ultrasonic data, the technique and instrumentation used in this experiment provide velocity precision of \u00b1 0.1% and accuracy of \u00b1 0.3% (95% confidence), and attenuation accuracy of \u00b1 0.1 dB cm-1 within the frequency range 300-1000 kHz (Best, 1992). The dataset presented here show the ultrasonic data at a single frequency of 600 kHz, obtained from Fourier analysis of broadband signals. \n\nPermeability to water and to N2 can be both determined with the aid of integrated flowmeters and pore pressure sensors both up- and downstream of the rock sample. \n\nThe rock samples include: Pre-Cambrian salt (unknown well, Pakistan (source: www.likit.co.uk\/)), Cambrian salt (unknown well, Tunguska Basin, Russia), Triassic salt (Arm Hill #1 well, NW Lancashire, UK), and Messinian salt (3A GN3 S02 well, core # 19, near Marianopoli, Sicily). 2.5 cm length, 5 cm diameter core plugs were extracted from precursor rocks, composition estimated by X-ray diffraction analysis, and connected porosity by He-pycnometry.\n\n   Falcon-Suarez, I., North, L., Amalokwu, K., Best, A., 2016.

Each sample was taken to 5% axial strain at a starting effective stress equivalent to 85% of its hydrostatic yield (P*) value, which were identified from yield under hydrostatic loading. These data for the 3 samples are presented as matlab data files. Post-deformation, each of the 3 cores underwent backscatter SEM and subsequent image analysis to examine any localised variations in porosity and grain size. These data are presented as csv files. Discrete bands form in each of the 3 sandstones but are distributed differently across each sample. Our results suggest that cement type plays a significant role in the micromechanics of deformation within each of the sandstones, which in turn, determines where the compaction bands nucleate and develop. These results may provide a starting point to investigate the role of cement on compaction localisation further.",

        "description": "Terrestrial palaeo-environmental proxy data has been collected to examine orbital changes in wildfire activity in the Early Jurassic of the Mochras Borehole, Cardigan Bay Basin, Wales. To do this a high resolution charcoal abundance dataset was created and quantified in two size fractions, microscopic charcoal (10-125 \u00b5) and macroscopic charcoal (>125 \u00b5). To take potential changes in riverine influx and\/or organic preservation in account on the charcoal abundance, palynofacies were analysed to document all terrestrial and marine organic particles present in the samples, and next to this, X-ray fluorescence data was gathered to assess detrital output. Mass spectrometry provided information on the carbonate and Total Organic Carbon content and bulk organic carbon isotopes. This information was used to look at changes in the lithology and the carbon cycle. Finally, clay mineralogical data was obtained to look at changes in the hydrological cycle in relation to wildfire activity.\nThis dataset spans 951-934 mbs from the Mochras borehole, which is the time equivalent of ~350 kyr, in the Margaritatus Zone of the Upper Pliensbachian. The Mochras sediments have been deposited in the Cardigan Bay Basin, Wales. At the time of deposition, this location was positioned in the Laurasian Seaway at a paleolatitude of ~35\u00b0N.\nThese datasets were obtained at a high resolution (10 cm) using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, mass spectrometry and palynological preparations. This high resolution was acquired to analyse the presence of precessional orbital forcing on wildfire and the other proxy datasets. \nThis data was collected, interpreted and analysed by Teuntje Hollaar, Claire Belcher, Stephen Hesselbo, Micha Ruhl, Jean-Fran\u04abois Deconinck, Sarah Jane Baker and Luke Mander. The complete dataset presented in the published article file \u2018Wildfire activity enhanced during phases of maximum orbital eccentricity and precessional forcing in the Early Jurassic\u2019 has been included in this data file.",

        "description": "This work presents a detailed three-dimensional finite element based model for wave propagation, combined with a postprocessing procedure to determine the fracture intensity caused by blasting. The data generated during this project includes output files of all simulations with detailed fields, geometries and meshes. The model incorporates the Johnson-Holmquist-2 constitutive model, which is designed for brittle materials undergoing high strain rates and high pressures and fracturing, and a tensile failure model. Material heterogeneity is introduced into the model through variation of the material properties at the element level, ensuring jumps in strain. The algorithm for the combined Johnson-Holmquist-2 and tensile failure model is presented and is demonstrated to be energy-conserving, with an open-source MATLAB implementation of the model. A range of sub-scale numerical experiments are performed to validate the modelling and postprocessing procedures, and a range of materials, explosive waves and geometries are considered to demonstrate the model's predictive capability quantitatively and qualitatively for fracture intensity. Fracture intensities on 2D planes and 3D volumes are presented. The mesh dependence of the method is explored, demonstrating that mesh density changes maintain similar results and improve with increasing mesh quality. Damage patterns in simulations are self-organising, forming thin, planar, fracture-like structures that closely match the observed fractures in the experiments. The presented model is an advancement in realism for continuum modelling of blasts as it enables fully three-dimensional wave interaction, handles damage due to both compression and tension, and relies only on measurable material properties. The uploaded data are the specific simulation outputs for four explosion models occurring on two different rock types, and the specific fracture patterns generated.",

        "description": "This dataset shows both the micro-scale mechanisms and acoustic response involved in shear failure of a deforming porous rock. To our knowledge, this is the first such dataset to combine simultaneous acoustic measurements and x-ray tomography imaging. It comprises a time-series of 3D in-situ synchrotron x-ray microtomography (\u00b5CT) volumes showing a Clashach sandstone sample (CL10) undergoing triaxial deformation to failure under a constant acoustic emissions (AE) event rate. Use of a constant AE event rate slowed down the failure process after peak stress, enabling shear failure to be captured in unprecedented spatio-temporal detail by the \u00b5CT volumes. These volumes are accompanied by the local incremental 3D strain fields and simultaneously acquired waveforms from acoustic emissions and ultrasonic velocity surveys, as well as mechanical bulk stress and strain. These data are fully explained in Cartwright-Taylor et al. Seismic events miss important grain-scale mechanisms governed by kinematics during shear failure of porous rock, in review at Nature Communications. We also include an equivalent time-series of the same data types showing a second Clashach sandstone sample (CL04) undergoing triaxial deformation to failure, this time under a constant strain rate where failure happened abruptly, shortly after peak stress. Both collections were acquired in-situ on the beamline I12-JEEP at the Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK, in September 2019. Each 3D \u00b5CT volume of the sample is contained in a .zip file labelled with the sequential scan number. Each volume comprises reconstructed 16-bit grey-scale data in a sequence of 2D image files (.tif), each numbered according to the depth at which it lies within the sample volume. The file dimensions are pixels, with an edge length of 7.91 \u00b5m. Two further .zip files contain the incremental 3D volumetric and deviatoric strain fields, obtained from digital volume correlation between neighbouring \u00b5CT volumes. Each strain field consists of a 32-bit 3D image file (.tif) in pixels with an edge length of 316.4 \u00b5m, labelled with its scan increment. Also included are (i) .csv files, containing the mechanical stress and strain time-series, the time and mechanical data at which each \u00b5CT volume was scanned, and the acoustic emissions event rate data, and (ii) .zip files containing times and waveforms for the acoustic emissions and ultrasonic velocity surveys as .ascii files. The .zip and .xlsx files are labelled with the sample name, the data type (grey-scale, strain-volumetric, strain-deviatoric, seismic, mechanical, mechCT, eventrateAE) and the sequential scan number (grey-scale only) according to the following convention: sample_datatype_scan#.

In October 2020, 48 anemones were collected at low tide by hand from Corbyn Head, Torquay, South Devon UK. A further 40 capture-bred anemones where collected from the Horniman Museum Aquarium, London, UK. Eight individual anemones were analysed for their microplastic contamination levels from the field. The remaining 80 were used to investigate the uptake of microplastics and the influence of food and temperature on that uptake. Anemones were digested after exposure or collection from the environment and the plastics enumerated. The environmental microplastics were also scored for the size, shape, colour. Their polymer was identified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. This work was undertaken by scientists at the University of Exeter as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) project MINIMISE (Current and Future Effects of Microplastics on Marine Shelf Ecosystems), funded under grant reference NE\/S003975\/1. MINIMISE aims to determine how microplastics and contaminants affect the functioning of marine shelf seas sediments and the organisms that live in them under different ocean chemistry conditions. It also aims to assist policy makers on determining how microplastics affect vulnerable habitats, aquaculture, fish spawning areas, fishing activities and other ecosystems.",

        "description": "The measurements and data contained here were obtained to study the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks, and more specifically the oxidation of rock organic carbon and the associated release of CO2. The primary aim was to better understand the production and mobility of the trace element rhenium during weathering, because this element has been proposed as a proxy for rock organic carbon oxidation. \nThe study focused on three Alpine catchments that drain sedimentary rocks, which all experience moderate to high erosion rates where oxidative weathering rates are thought to operate faster. Two catchments were located in Switzerland - the Erlenbach and Vogelbach, and one catchment in Colorado, USA - the East River. To study chemical weathering and the production and mobility of rhenium, a suite of samples were collected to capture the source and products of weathering reactions. These focused on stream and river water, river sediments and weathering profiles collected on sedimentary rocks.\nThe Swiss catchments, water samples were collected from 2011 and 2012 to capture changes in river flow and seasonal changes in hydro-climate. Samples were collected from a gauging station operated by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research - WSL. In the East River, samples were collected from the gauging station operated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area from 2015 and 2016. Additional samples included snow samples collected from the Erlenbach. \nAll water samples were analysed for their major dissolved ion content by Ion Chromatography. Dissolved rhenium concentrations were determined by High Resolution and Quadrupole Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Solid samples were digested and analysed for Re content by ICP-MS. These geochemical measurements were paired with water discharge data to quantify the flux of dissolved elements, using rating curves and flux-weighted average methods, and interpret the hydrological context of ion production and mobility through the landscape.\nThis new data acquisition was funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant to Robert Hilton (ROC-CO2 project, grant 678779) and a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK, Standard Grant (NE\/I001719\/1).\nFurther details of subsequent data analysis and interpretation can be found in Hilton, R.G., et al., 2021, Concentration-discharge relationships of dissolved rhenium in Alpine catchments reveal its use as a tracer of oxidative weathering, Water Resources Research",

        "description": "The measurements and data contained here were obtained to study the release of carbon dioxide during the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks. The primary aim of the research was to explore how these CO2 fluxes were related to environmental parameters (temperature, hydrology). Weathering of sedimentary rocks can result in CO2 release from the oxidation of rock organic carbon oxidation, but also due to the oxidation of sulfide minerals, production of sulfuric acid and subsequent release of CO2 from carbonate minerals. These rock-derived carbon sources are understudied, and form an important part of the geological carbon cycle. The CO2 flux measurements were made on 5 rock chambers (H4, H6, H7, H8 and H13) installed in the Draix-Bleone Critical Zone Observatory, France, on outcrops of Jurassic marls. Measurements and data were collected from December 2016 to May 2019. Regular visits to the site (~4 per year) returned data on total CO2 flux (see data in Total-CO2-flux.csv). This was explored as a function of temperature and ambient hydroclimate (precipitation). The datasets include the total CO2 flux measured at each visit to a chamber, and measurements of the internal chamber temperature. To determine the source of CO2 measured in the chambers, we trapped the CO2 using zeolite sieves and recovered it in the laboratory. The radiocarbon activity (reported as fraction modern, F14C) and its stable isotope composition (d13C) were measured from CO2 collected from chambers H4 and H6 over the sampling period (Radiocarbon-data.csv). These measurements were used in a mixing analysis to partition the source of CO2 between rock organic carbon and carbonate using a mixing model approach (Partitioned-CO2-fluxes.csv), as explained in full detail in the published paper Soulet et al., 2021, Nature Geoscience. We also measured the geochemical characteristics of the bedrocks that are undergoing weathering at the field site (rock-geochemical-composition.csv), including the organic carbon concentration, inorganic carbon concentration and their isotopic composition, and sulfur concentration. Finally, we measured environmental variables of interest: the chamber temperature (chamber-temperature.csv) and the air temperature at the Draix-Bleone observatory (Air-temperature-at-laval-le-plateau-weather-station.csv, respectively). This research was funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant to Robert Hilton (ROC-CO2 project, grant 678779) and Radiocarbon and stable isotope measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK, (NERC National Environmental Isotope Facility NEIF Radiocarbon Allocation 2074.1017) to Guillaume Soulet, Robert Hilton and Mark Garnett.

For the first time, zones of influence have been integrated (for evaporites, oil shales and building stones) to indicate the areas surrounding mining sites which might be impacted. The data have been compiled and presented in an easy to use format to provide a national overview of the country's mining legacy.

The dataset allows users to visualise the extent and distribution of mineral resources and to relate them to other forms of land-use (such as urban areas or designated environmentally sensitive areas) or to other factors (such as transport infrastructure and conservation information).\nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) was awarded a grant from the Welsh Assembly Government Aggregates Levy Fund in 2009 to provide a comprehensive, relevant and accessible information base to enhance the sustainability of mineral resources for Wales. BGS co-funded this project through its Sustainable Mineral Solutions project. This work was completed in 2010. This dataset comprises the digital GIS files which were produced through this project. \nThe major elements of minerals information presented on the maps are; the geological distribution of all onshore mineral resources in Wales, the location of mineral extraction sites, the recorded occurrences of metallic minerals, the recorded location of former slate quarries and significant areas of slate waste and the recorded location of historic building stone quarries. \nIn 2020 minor revisions to geometry and attributes were made in in response to minor corrections that were required. The paper maps were not re-released with these data updates. Point data for mineral occurrence and mine site data has not been included in this revision as these data are superseded by other BGS datasets, such as the BGS BritPits database of mines and quarries. \nThe BGS Mineral Resource data does not determine mineral reserves and therefore does not denote potential areas of extraction. Only onshore, mainland mineral resources are included in the dataset. This dataset has been produced by the collation and interpretation of mineral resource data principally held by the British Geological Survey. The mineral resource data presented are based on the best available information, but are not comprehensive and their quality is variable. The dataset should only be used to show a broad distribution of those mineral resources which may be of current or potential economic interest.",

Since surface nanobubbles were first imaged in 2000, they have been of growing interest to research due to their long lived properties, with reported lifetimes as long as several hours. Images of nanobubbles were produced under water, collector and depressant conditions using the air water supersaturation method. These are the first images of surface nanobubbles on dolomite. Surface nanobubbles could play a part in the processing of dolomite via froth flotation. These images lay a foundation for future analysis of the effect of nanobubbles in flotation.",

We applied differential imaging on Estaillades carbonate to (a) distinguish micro-porous regions from macro-pores, and (b) determine fluid phase pore occupancy and relative permeability at a capillary number, Ca = 7.3\u00d710-6. The sample porosity was approximately 28 %, with 7% in macro-pores and 21% in pores that could not be directly resolved (micro-porosity). We find that, in addition to brine and decane, a fraction of the macroscopic pore space contains an intermittent phase, which is occupied either by brine or oil during the hour-long scan time. Furthermore, fluid occupancy in micro-porosity was classified into three sub-phases: micro-pore space with oil, micro-pore space with brine, and micro pores partially filled with oil and brine.",

The tomographic images were acquired at a voxel-resolution of 5.2 \u00b5m and time-resolution of 33 minutes. The data were collected with lab based microCT, with an aim of investigating the influences of rock mineral and physical heterogeneity on dissolution patterns and changes to dynamic rock properties at the pore-scale. Further details of the experimental methodology can be found in Al-Khulaifi et al. (2019).

        "description": "The images in this dataset show the mixing of two liquid solutions in a random bead pack as a function of time and in three-dimensions. The working fluids used in this study are solutions of methanol and ethylene-glycol (MEG, fluid 1) and brine (fluid 2). In particular, three mixtures of ethylene-glycol and methanol were prepared that differ in wt% ethylene-glycol, namely 55 wt% (MEG55), 57 wt% (MEG57) and 59 wt% (MEG59). Measurements are conducted using in the regime of Rayleigh numbers, Ra = 2000-5000. X-ray Computed Tomography is applied to image the spatial and temporal evolution of the solute plume non -invasively. The tomograms are used to compute macroscopic quantities including the rate of dissolution and horizontally averaged concentration profiles, and enable the visualisation of the ow patterns that arise upon mixing at a spatial resolution of about (2x2x2) mm3. We observe that the mixing process evolves systematically through three stages, starting from pure diffusion, followed by convection-dominated and shutdown. A modified diffusion equation is applied to model the convective process with an onset time of convection that compares favourably with literature data and an effective diffusion coefficient that is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusivity of the solute. The comparison of the experimental observations of convective mixing against their numerical counterparts of the purely diffusive scenario enables the estimation of a non-dimensional convective mass flux in terms of the Sherwood number, Sh = 0.025Ra. We observe that the latter scales linearly with Ra, in agreement with observations from both experimental and numerical studies on thermal convection over the same Ra regime.",

        "description": "The images in this dataset are a sample of Bentheimer Sandstone from a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scan acquired with a voxel resolution of 6.00\u00b5m. We imaged the steady state flow of brine and decane in Bentheimer sandstone. We devised an experimental method based on differential imaging to examine how flow rate impacts the pore-scale distribution of fluids during coinjection. This allows us to elucidate flow regimes (connected, or breakup of the nonwetting phase pathways) for a range of fractional flows at two capillary numbers, Ca, namely 3.0E-7 and 7.5E-6. At the lower Ca, for a fixed fractional flow, the two phases appear to flow in connected unchanging subnetworks of the pore space, consistent with conventional theory. At the higher Ca, we observed that a significant fraction of the pore space contained sometimes oil and sometimes brine during the 1 h scan: this intermittent occupancy, which was interpreted as regions of the pore space that contained both fluid phases for some time, is necessary to explain the flow and dynamic connectivity of the oil phase; pathways of always oil-filled portions of the void space did not span the core. This phase was segmented from the differential image between the 30 wt % KI brine image and the scans taken at each fractional flow. Using the grey scale histogram distribution of the raw images, the oil proportion in the intermittent phase was calculated. The pressure drops at each fractional flow at low and high flow rates were measured by high precision differential pressure sensors. The relative permeabilities and fractional flow obtained by our experiment at the mm-scale compare well with data from the literature on cm-scale samples.",

        "description": "The spreadsheet gathers the data collected during a brine:CO2 flow-through experiment conducted on a synthetic sandstone core sample to present the capabilities of a novel 'multiflow experimental rig for CO2 experiments' designed and assembled at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. The test was configured to assess geophysical monitoring techniques in shallow tight (North Sea-like) CO2 storage sandstone reservoirs. The tests were conducted in the rock physics laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, during 2015, as part of the DiSECCS project with funding from the United Kingdom\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant EP\/K035878\/1) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The experiment was a steady state brine-CO2 flow-through test to replicate CO2 geosequestration conditions and evaluate geophysical monitoring techniques. The confining and pore pressure conditions were similar to those estimated for shallow North Sea \u2013 like storage reservoirs, but simulating inflation\/depletion cyclic scenarios for increasing brine:CO2 fractional flow rates. The data include ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and their respective attenuation factors, axial strains, and electrical resistivity; also relative permeability to both fluids (CO2 and brine) is displayed as a function of pore volume times, associated to increasing CO2 to brine contents in the sample.",

        "description": "Geochemical data has been collected on samples from new exposures of the 1883 deposits, revealed by the 2018 tsunamigenic flank collapse of Anak Krakatau, which provides improved stratigraphic context. Whole-rock data taken by X-ray Florescence shows no systematic stratigraphic correlation. Chemical data for transects across, and spot points on, plagioclase phenocrysts, including some trace element data, all obtained using Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), with Backscatter electron (BSE) images of crystals, obtained using Scanning Electron Microscope, reveal complex zoning profiles. However, chemical data for transects across pyroxene phenocrysts, obtained using EPMA, show this phenocryst phase is largely unzoned. The dataset also includes chemical data for spots on Fe\/Ti oxides, included on the rims of pyroxene, and obtained using EPMA. Matrix glass chemistry, obtained via EPMA, shows that the early eruptive ash is more evolved than the pyroclastic material that follows, and that there is a slight overall trend to a more homogenous, less evolved melt composition.\nThe 1883 eruption of Krakatau was a large, cardera-forming eruption that caused approximately 36,000 fatalities. It is also the only eruption of its size to have accompanying written accounts.",

        "description": "Linear features (shown as polylines) represent seven classes of geological structural features e.g. faults, folds or landforms e.g. buried channels, glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). The scale of the data is 1:10 000 scale. Onshore coverage is partial with approximately 30% of England, Scotland and Wales available in the version 2 data release. BGS intend to continue developing coverage at this scale; current focus is to include all large priority urban areas, along with road and rail transport corridors. Linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults. However landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits. The linear features are organised into seven main categories: Alteration area indicating zones of change to the pre-existing rocks due to the application of heat and pressure can occur round structural features such as faults and dykes. Fault where a body of bedrock has been fractured and displaced by a large scale process affecting the earth\u2019s crust. Fold where strata are bent or deformed resulting from changes or movement of the earth\u2019s surface creating heat and pressure to reshape and transform the original horizontal strata. Folds appear on all scales, in all rock types and from a variety of causes. Fossil horizons where prolific fossil assemblages occur and can be used to help establishing the order in which deposits were laid down (stratigraphy). These horizons allow correlation where sediments of the same age look completely different due to variations in depositional environment. Mineral vein where concentrations of crystallised mineral occur within a rock, they are closely associated with faulting but may occur independently. Landforms define the landscape by its surface form; these include glacial features such as drumlins, eskers and ice margins. Rock identifies key (marker) beds, recognised as showing distinct physical characteristics or fossil content. Examples include coal seams, gypsum beds and marine bands. The data are available in vector format (containing the geometry of each feature linked to a database record describing their attributes) as ESRI shapefiles and are available under BGS data licence.",

        "description": "This dataset contains visual and physical analyses of the impacts of ocean acidification on the skeletons of the cold-water coral <em>Lophelia pertusa<\/em>. Visual analysis includes synchrotron images from the Diamond Light Source and electron back scatter diffraction images on polished coral skeletons. Physical analyses include Raman spectroscopy data. Skeletal samples analysed were from the Southern California Bight (SCB), USA, and the Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC), UK. SCB samples were collected in 2010, 2014 and 2015. MRC samples were collected in 2012. Samples from the SCB cover an environmental gradient with respect to aragonite saturation, and corals from Mingulay were subjected to long-term experimentation in projected future conditions. SCB carbonate chemistry and sample metadata is included here, and conditions for MRC samples are outlined in Hennige et al. 2015. Ocean acidification is a threat to cold-water coral reefs in terms of dissolution to their skeletons, and their subsequent structural stability. This will likely determine the stability of the habitats they form.

        "description": "Adventdalen is a medium-sized (513 km^2) catchment in continuous permafrost zone of central Spitsbergen. It has 11.7 % glacier cover, a large flat valley floor comprised of uplifted, glaciomarine sediments, covered in the lower part by a veneer of aeolian sediments up to 4 m thick. The geology of the catchment is dominated by sandstones, shales and carbonates. There are a series of five open system pingos that have formed in the valley floor following uplift of the valley bottom over the last 10000 years. This has caused permafrost aggradation in former marine sediments which are up to 60 m thick. During the formation of this new permafrost, high pressure caused expulsion of groundwaters below, resulting in their upward migration. Freezing of the groundwaters as they reached the ground surface caused expansion and thus formation of the pingo. However, freezing no longer occurs at four of the five pingos, meaning that the groundwaters now discharge at the surface. Samples of the emerging groundwaters were collected every March\/April, but also opportunistically during summer months, provided the sites weren't flooded. Analysis of major ions (by ion chromatography), minor constituents (trace metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and silica by colorimetric analysis) and gases (O2, CO2 and CH4) were undertaken. Funding was provided by the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI-Climate Topic 2: Russian Arctic and Boreal Systems) Award No. 71126, distributed to Principal Investigator, Andrew Hodson (then of University of Sheffield) via NERC grant NE\/M019829\/1.",

        "description": "This dataset contains foraminifera abundance data and chronological information for samples taken from surface sediments and tidal marsh cores from sites at Chezzetcook (Nova Scotia), Sanborn Cove (Maine), and Barn Island (Connecticut). Relative sea-level (RSL) data has been determined by subtracting the elevation at which a fossil sample was originally deposited (calculated by a microfossil transfer function) from its present elevation (measured relative to national geodetic datums). Transfer functions were based on foraminiferal assemblages from previously collected data sets and, in one site (Connecticut), additional local foraminiferal data. The sampled depths cover age ranges of ~960 \u2013 2010 CE (Chezzetcook), ~1741 \u2013 2010 CE (Sanborn Cove), and ~1552 \u2013 2010 CE (Barn Island). Foraminifera data were quantified in core CZ-25 from Chezzetcook, core SN-3.3 from Sanborn Cove, and core BI-47.5 from Barn Island using light microscopy. For the foraminifera abundance data from samples taken from the surface sediments, at Chezzetcook marsh we used the local transfer function developed by Gehrels et al. (2005) from 46 foraminiferal samples collected by Scott and Medioli (Scott and Medioli, 1980). Scott and Medioli grouped Balticammina pseudomacrescens and Jadammina macrescens together as Trochammina macrescens. We also combined these foraminifera in our training set because it was not possible to retrospectively split these taxa. For the transfer function applied at Sanborn Cove we used the regional Maine dataset of Gehrels (2000). We removed all low marsh and tidal flat samples, leaving 44 samples containing the six primary agglutinated salt-marsh foraminiferal taxa. For the Connecticut transfer function we used the dataset of Edwards et al. (2004) and included 26 new samples we collected from Barn Island. The chronological data were derived using a variety of dating methods, including 14C, 210Pb, 137Cs, 206Pb\/207Pb, tephra, pollen markers and trace metal markers. The dataset includes 70 dated depths at Chezzetcook, 37 dated depths at Sanborn Cove, and 44 dated depths at Barn Island. The oldest uncalibrated radiocarbon age at Chezzetcook is 996 +\/- 36 14C years, with the surface dating to 2004 CE. At Sanborn Cove, the oldest date is 2064 +\/- 35 14C years, with the surface dating to 2010 CE. At Barn Island, the oldest date is 1020 +\/- 23 14C years, with the surface dating to 2010 CE. The radiocarbon dates include high precision dates obtained by pooling the mean of multiple age determinations on individual plant fragments at 2 sigma precision. This significantly reduces the error of the 14C ages for samples younger than ~300 calendar years (to between +\/-9 and +\/-17 14C yrs). Measurements of &apos;bomb-spike&apos; AMS14C in plant fragments are used to test model selection for 210Pb analyses. Age models are developed for cores using the Bayesian age-modelling software Bacon which takes into account the stratigraphical position of the sample, thereby reducing the number of possible solutions for the calibrated ages of the samples. The data were collected as part of an investigation into pre-industrial sea-level rise hotspots in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. The grant (NE\/G003440\/1): North Atlantic sea-level variability during the last half-millennium, aimed to quantify sea-level changes in the recent past in order to provide more accurate and precise predictions for the future.

        "title": "The impact of mineral dissolution on drainage relative permeability and residual trapping in two carbonate rocks",
        "description": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into deep saline aquifers is governed by a number of physico-chemical processes including mineral dissolution and precipitation, multiphase fluid flow, and capillary trapping. These processes can be coupled, however, the impact of fluid-rock reaction on the multiphase flow properties is difficult to study and is not simply correlated to variation in rock porosity. We observed the impact of rock mineral dissolution on multiphase flow properties in two carbonate rocks with distinct pore structures. The Ketton carbonate was an ooidal limestone with a distinct bimodal pore structure whereas the Estaillades limestone was a bioclastic limestone with a wide range of pore sizes.  Observations of steady state N2-water relative permeability and residual trapping were obtained at 100 bars fluid pressure and 22oC, with X-ray tomography used to estimate fluid saturation. These tests alternated with steps in which mineral was uniformly dissolved into solution from the rock cores using an aqueous solution with a temperature controlled acid. Eight alternating sequences of dissolution and flow measurement were performed, with on average 0.5% of the mass of the rocks dissolved at each stage. A sequence of mercury injection capillary pressure measurements were conducted on a parallel set of samples undergoing the same treatment to characterize the evolving pore size distribution and corresponding capillary pressure characteristics.  Variations in the multiphase flow properties were observed to correspond to the changes in the underlying pore structure. In the Ketton carbonate, dissolution resulted in an increase of the fraction of pore volume made up by the smallest pores and a corresponding increase in the fraction made up by the largest pores. This resulted in a systematic increase in the relative permeability to the nonwetting phase and decrease in relative permeability of the wetting phase. There was also a modest but systematic decrease in residual trapping. In the Estaillades carbonate, dissolution resulted in an increase in the fraction of pore volume made up by pores in the central range of the initial pore size distribution, and a corresponding decrease in the fraction made up by both the smallest and largest pores. This resulted in a decrease in the relative permeability to both the wetting and nonwetting fluid phases and no discernible impact on the residual trapping.  In summary, the impact of rock matrix dissolution will be strongly dependent on the impact of that dissolution on the underlying pore structure of the rock. However, if the variation in pore structure can be observed or estimated with modelling, then it should be possible to estimate the impacts on multiphase flow properties.",

The model allows users to visualise the surveyed and probable coal mine workings to be found beneath this part of Glasgow, applicable at a scale of around 1: 25,000 to 1: 10,000. The data is supplied as grids, triangulated surfaces over a 5 by 4.15 km area, with the depth range to around 300 m below Ordnance Datum. The mine extents are \u2018cut out\u2019 of the UKGEOS Glasgow post-drill bedrock model. This model describes both surveyed (recorded on mine abandonment plan) and probable coal mine workings. An area of probable workings has been updated to account for the results of drilling borehole GGC01.
