        "description": "This dataset includes sediment trap, sediment core and loss-on-ignition to total organic carbon measurements from a PhD research project at Rostherne Mere in Cheshire. These data were collected to show the relationship between the changing nutrient loads and subsequent organic carbon burial over the last 120 years. The sediment trap data cover the period from May 2010 to August 2016, while the sediment core was taken in September 2011 and has been 210Pb dated to circa 1360AD. All data is presented for date, loss-on-ignition (LOI) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3), with sediment trap data converted into net flux measurements and sediment core data calculated for net sedimentation rate following 210Pb dating. The conversion from LOI to total organic carbon was measured using mass spectrometry and applied to the trap and core data. The work was carried out as part of a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) funded PhD [grant number NE\/L002493\/1], with part of the work also funded by the NERC small grant [grant number NE\/H011978\/1].",

        "title": "The Arctic sea ice proxy, IP25, in particulate organic matter (POM) from surface waters and bottom sea-ice of the Central Arctic Ocean during the MOSAiC expedition in 2019\/2020",
        "description": "During the MOSAiC expedition in the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO, 2019-2020), POM was sampled weekly to fortnightly from surface waters and the Chlorophyll a maximum layer (Chl a max) via CTD casts and from bottom sea ice of the floe via ice coring (first- and second-year ice, two layers nearest to the water-ice interface). The POM was filtered onboard (GF\/F filters) and deep frozen for the subsequent analysis of a suite of lipid biomarkers, including IP25 and other highly-branched isoprenoids (HBI), fatty acids (FA) and sterols. These biomarkers can provide valuable information about the nutritional value, the taxonomic composition (e.g. diatoms vs flagellates), and the origin of the POM that represents the basis of the Central Arctic food web. This dataset comprises the results from the HBI analysis only, while the FA dataset is already published and the sterol data will be submitted shortly. The separation of the various lipid biomarkers was carried out at the University of Plymouth. After addition of internal standards for each of the 3 components, the filters were saponified with KOH.\nThereafter, non-saponifiable lipids (HBI and sterols) were extracted with hexane and purified by open column chromatography (SiO2). Fatty acids were obtained by adding concentrated HCl to the saponified solution and re-extracted with hexane. The analysis of IP25 was carried out using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC), coupled to an Agilent 5975 mass selective detector (mass spectrometry, MS), fitted with an Agilent HP-5ms column with auto-splitless injection and helium carrier gas. Identification of IP25 and other HBIs was achieved by comparison of their individual GC retention indices and mass spectra with those obtained from purified standards. IP25 was quantified by, first, integrating individual ion responses in selected-ion monitoring mode (m\/z 350.3), second, normalising these to the corresponding peak area of the internal standard and, third, applying an instrumental response factor obtained from a purified standard. These IP25 quantities per filter can be normalised to the volume of filtered seawater or melted ice core water. \n\nContributions by KS were funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council MOSAiC Thematic project SYM-PEL: ''Quantifying the contribution of sympagic versus pelagic diatoms to Arctic food webs and biogeochemical fluxes: application of source-specific highly branched isoprenoid biomarkers''\/ (NE\/S002502\/1)",

        "description": "This dataset reports chemical speciation of airborne gas and aerosol particulate matter (PM) sampled in various locations on the Island of Hawai'i in 2018 and 2019. The 2018 samples were collected during a large eruption of Kilauea volcano. The 2019 samples were collected during a period of very low volcanic activity. Samples were collected in several locations on the Island of Hawai'i, Hawaii, USA. Time-series samples were collected at -Leilani Estates -Volcano village -Pahala, Ocean View -Kailua-Kona -Mauna Loa Observatory in 2018 and 2019. Point-source samples were collected at the following locations -The main erupting vent 'Fissure 8' on the Kilauea Volcano in 2018, and repeated in its vicinity post-eruption in 2019 - The lava ocean entry point in 2018 and repeated in its vicinity post-eruption in 2019. The samples were collected using filter packs (FP) and Sioutas cascade impactors (SKC). The instruments were used at ground-level in all cases except for samples FP_08_1, FP_ 09_1, FP_09_2, SKC_08 and SKC_09 which were attached to an Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) in order to safely access the erupting vent and the lava ocean entry. The samples were then analysed using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ion chromatography (IC). Sample analysis was done at the University of Leeds, United Kingdom (2018 samples) and the University of Leeds and Open University, United Kingdom (2019 samples). The results are reported as concentration per volume of air sampled (\u00b5g\/m^3) to 2 significant figures. This was done to - assess the dispersion of major and trace elements in a volcanic plume, and quantify their depletion rates from the source into the far-field (up to ~240 km downwind) - assess the impact of volcanic emissions on the composition of the local atmosphere. The data were produced as a result of a collaborative project between the Universities of Leeds, Cambridge, Oxford (UK), Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the United States Geological Survey, and the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (USA).",

        "title": "Fatty acid composition of 32 cold-water algal strains cultured under different conditions to support the interpretation of in situ algal FA data from the MOSAiC expedition 2019\/2020",
        "description": "A seasonal cycle of the FA composition of particulate organic matter from surface waters, Chlorophyll-a maximum layer and bottom sea ice, sampled during the MOSAiC expedition in the Central Arctic Ocean (2019-2020), suggests the importance of phylogenetic and environmental drivers. To improve our understanding of these different drivers, we conducted culture experiments with 32 cold-water algal strains where temperature, light intensity, and nutrient supply were manipulated individually or in combination. The culture experiments were carried out at the Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP; Oban, Scotland), the Roscoff Culture Collection (RCC; Roscoff, France) and the Alfred-Wegener-Institute-Helmholtz-Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI; Bremerhaven, Germany). The strains were part of the culture collections, had been isolated in the Arctic (25 strains), Southern Ocean (2 strains) or North Atlantic (5 strains), and included diatoms, chlorophytes, haptophytes, cryptophytes, chrysophytes, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Some of the species are Arctic sea ice diatoms (e.g. Nitzschia frigida, Attheya spp.) or pelagic diatoms (e.g. Thalassiosira gravida), while others are non-diatom species that are becoming increasingly prominent in the Arctic, e.g. the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (synonym Gephyrocapsa huxleyi), the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii, the chlorophyte Micromonas spp. and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus spp.. The experiments can be divided into three groups: First, those that tested a low light-low temperature setting, second, those that tested a low light-low temperature and a higher light-higher temperature setting and, third, those that tested the effect of nutrient (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) shortage in combination with low and high light intensity. The first set of experiments was conducted with all 32 strains, the second set with all strains grown at CCAP and AWI, and the third set focuses on the keystone under-ice diatom Melosira arctica. The experiments were run for 4-7 weeks to accumulate sufficient biomass for biomarker extractions (FA and sterols), C:N analysis and light-microscopy of cell size and cell concentration. At the end of the experiments, the algae were filtered onto GF\/F filters and deep frozen until analysis. This dataset comprises the results from the FA analysis only (sterol and C:N analysis are separate). The separation of the lipid biomarkers was carried out at the University of Plymouth. After addition of internal standards for FA and sterols, the filters were saponified with KOH. Thereafter, non-saponifiable lipids (sterols) were extracted with hexane and purified by open column chromatography on silica gel. FA were obtained by adding concentrated HCl to the saponified solution and re-extracted with hexane. Further steps of the FA analysis were carried out at the AWI. Here samples were converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and analysed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph with FID detector. The Clarity chromatography software system (DataApex, Czech Republic) was used for chromatogram data evaluation. FAME were quantified via the internal standard, Tricosanoic acid methyl ester (23:0) (Supelco, Germany) to provide the total amount of FA (TFA) per filter. These FA datasets of cultured algae are presented in a manuscript together with the FA pattern seen in sea ice- and water column POM in the CAO during the MOSAiC expedition and in previously published data from Arctic shelf regions. The manuscript focusses mainly on two important long-chain omega-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) that are considered essential for the nutrition of higher trophic levels, including humans, and their production to decline with global temperature rise.\n\nContributions by KS were funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council MOSAiC Thematic project SYM-PEL: 'Quantifying the contribution of sympagic versus pelagic diatoms to Arctic food webs and biogeochemical fluxes: application of source-specific highly branched isoprenoid biomarkers'\/ (NE\/S002502\/1).

        "description": "This dataset presents biweekly gridded sea ice thickness and uncertainty for the Arctic derived from the European Space Agency's satellite CryoSat-2. An associated 'developer's product' also includes intermediate parameters used or output in the sea ice thickness processing chain. Data are provided as biweekly grids with a resolution of 80 km, mapped onto a Northern Polar Stereographic Grid, covering the Arctic region north of 50 degrees latitude, for all months of the year between October 2010 and July 2020. CryoSat-2 Level 1b Baseline-D observed radar waveforms have been retracked using two different approaches, one for the 'cold season' months of October-April and the second for 'melting season' months of May-September. The cold season retracking algorithm uses a numerical model for the SAR altimeter backscattered echo from snow-covered sea ice presented in Landy et al. (2019), which offers a physical treatment of the effect of ice surface roughness on retracked ice and ocean elevations. The method for optimizing echo model fits to observed CryoSat-2 waveforms, retracking waveforms, classifying returns, and deriving sea ice radar freeboard are detailed in Landy et al. (2020). The melting season retracking algorithm uses the SAMOSA+ analytical echo model with optimization to observed CryoSat-2 waveforms through the SARvatore (SAR Versatile Altimetric Toolkit for Ocean Research and Exploitation) service available through ESA Grid Processing on Demand (GPOD). The method for classifying radar returns and deriving sea ice radar freeboard in the melting season are detailed in Dawson et al. (2022). The melting season sea ice radar freeboards require a correction for an electromagnetic range bias, as described in Landy et al. (2022). After applying the correction, year-round freeboards are converted to sea ice thickness using auxiliary satellite observations of the sea ice concentration and type, as well as snow depth and density estimates from a Lagrangian snow evolution scheme: SnowModel-LG (Stroeve et al., 2020; Liston et al., 2020). The sea ice thickness uncertainties have been estimated based on methods described in Landy et al. (2022). NetCDF files contain detailed descriptions of each parameter.

Columns effluents were analysed periodically for key biogeochemical indicators (nitrate, sulfate) and trace metals (iron, manganese, uranium) and systems were sacrificed after 6 and 12 months of groundwater flow. Upon sacrifice, columns were cross-sectioned, and the sediment structure preserved for synchrotron micro-focus X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) mapping, and uranium L-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. Sub-samples of column sediments were also analysed for acid extractable metals, microbial abundance and classification and bioavailable Fe(II) concentrations.\nExperiments were performed between March 2016 and March 2017. Subsequent analyses were performed between March 2017 and December 2018.\nThis data was collected as part of the project: Understanding radioactive \u2018hot\u2019 particle evolution in the environment funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (grant NE\/M014088\/1).",

        "description": "This dataset contains information about surface and sub-surface hydraulic and hydrological soil properties across the Thames (UK) catchment. Soil dry bulk density, estimated soil porosity, soil moisture and soil moisture retention (to 100 cm suction) were determined through laboratory analysis of soil samples collected at five depths between the surface and 100 cm below ground level (where possible). Surface soil infiltration rates were measured, and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated at 25 cm and 45 cm depths (where possible). Field scale point data were collected at seven sites in the Thames Catchment, with three sub-groups of sites under different land use and management practices. The first land management group included three arable fields in the Cotswolds, Gloucestershire, on shallow soils over Limestone with no grass in rotation, herbal leys in rotation or rye and clover in rotation. The second group included two arable fields in near Wantage, Oxfordshire, on free draining loamy soils over chalk with conventional management or controlled traffic. The final group included a permanent grassland and broadleaf woodland on slowly permeable soil over mudstone near Oxford, Oxfordshire. Data were collected in representative infield areas; trafficked areas (e.g. tramlines or animal tracks), and untrafficked margins. Samples and measurements were taken between April 2021 and October 2021, with repeats taken before and after harvest. Soil samples were collected using Eijkelkamp 07.53.SC sample ring kit with closed ring holder and the Edelman auger and Stony auger when required. Infiltration measurements were taken using Mini Disk Infiltrometers. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using Guelph permeameters. Soil bulk density and porosity were calculated using oven drying methods. Soil moisture retention was calculated using an Eijelkamp Sandbox. This dataset was collected by UKCEH as part of the 'Land management in lowland catchments for integrated flood risk reduction' (LANDWISE) project. LANDWISE seeks to examine how land use and management can be used to reduce the risk of flooding for communities. LANDWISE is one of three projects comprising the Natural Environment Research Council Natural Flood Management Research Programme.

        "description": "This dataset gathers the data collected during a brine:CO2 flow-through experiments conducted on three sandstones with similar mineralogical compositions (major minerals) but different porosity, clay-size fraction and clay mineralogy. The aim was to study the effect of such heterogeneities on interpretation of geophysical data. Geophysical and transport data were collected before, during and after exposing each sample to CO2, and analysed with basic petrophysical properties. \nThe tests were conducted in the high-pressure, room-temperature (20\u00b0C) experimental setup for multi-flow-through tests in the Rock Physics Laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS), during 2022, as part of the OASIS, EHMPRES and FOCUS projects with funding from the Research Council of Norway (RCN grant no. 280472 - OASIS) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC grants NE\/X003248\/1 - FAPESP-EHMPRES, and NE\/X006271\/1 - FOCUS). \nTo simulate the specific effective stress conditions of the target CO2 storage reservoir in Aurora (Aker et al., 2021), northern North Sea, the confining and pore pressure conditions of the reservoir were accommodated to our lab  temperature conditions. We measured ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and attenuations, axial strains and electrical resistivity for an increasing CO2 saturation. The degree of brine saturation was inferred from the electrical resistivity using the modified Archie\u2019s empirical relationship to account for the contribution of clay minerals, based on the Waxman\u2013Smits\u2013Juhasz model (see further details in, e.g., Falcon-Suarez et al.

The cores have been collected with a push corer using PVC pipes of 5 cm diameter by a team from BIUST led by Dr. Franchi between November 2017 and February 2018. The data were collected as part of the PULA project, which aimed at understanding the immediate effect of heavy rainfall and floods on water resources in arid Botswana and their transitional hydrologic readjustment towards the dry period, and the role of these events in supporting either or both resources replenishment and contamination. Grain size profiles of the cores have been obtained by analyzing wet sediments with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The OM content of the sediments was obtained by measuring the loss on ignition (LOI) of bulk sediments after calcination in a muffle furnace. The sediments have been analyzed for trace metal distribution using a Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (MP-AES). The grain size distribution has allowed to pinpoint the presence of flood couplets, characterized by coarse lags followed by fine grained materials. The trace metal distribution profiles have been compared with the flood couplets to assess the entity of metal mobilization during floods and subsequent droughts.",

Prior to strength test, each sample was either oven dried (ca. 12 hours at 85 \u00b0C followed by cooling in a desiccator for 1 hour) or water saturated (samples in distilled water under vacuum for 24 hours). A subset of these samples has also been thermally treated at 150, 300, 450 and 600oC to induce thermal cracking prior to the mechanical testing. All tests were conducted at 10-5 s-1 axial strain rate in assumed drained conditions when relevant, and at room temperature. For saturated tests, the initial loading was applied in two steps, first by increasing Pc hydrostatically (\u03c31=\u03c32=\u03c33) until the desired confining pressure was reached, and then introducing pore fluid pressure, as per the functionality of the experimental set-up.

For each experiment, time, axial force, axial displacement, axial stress, confining displacement, confining pressure, axial strain A and B, axial average strain, circumferential extensometer, circumferential strain, volumetric strain, internal temperature, and axial delta P were recorded. Triaxial testing was undertaken using the MTS 815 servo-controlled stiff frame inside a vessel capable of a confining pressure up to 140 MPa at the Rock Mechanics and Physics Laboratory, British Geological Survey, UK. The confining cell is fitted with external heater bands and utilizing utilizes cascade control from internal and external thermocouples (accurate to \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C). An initial axial pre-load of 2.3 kN was applied, to ensure a stable contact and alignment of the platens. The confining pressure vessel was then closed and filled with mineral oil confining fluid. The axial pre-load was maintained whilst the confining pressure was applied at 2 MPa\/min to 60 or 120 MPa; these values were chosen to approximately bracket the pressures at the up-dip limit of seismic nucleation, corresponding to 2 \u2013 4 km depth (Arroyo et al., 2014). At this point, whilst held in axial force and confining pressure control, the rig was heated at 2\u00b0C\/min to 60\u00b0C to approximate the average temperature conditions at the depth of the up-dip limit of seismic nucleation (Harris and Spinelli, 2010). The samples were then left for approximately 1 hour allowing thermal equilibrium to be reached throughout the confining fluid and the samples. Once stable, axial loading was initiated in constant axial strain rate control at a rate of 5.0 x 10-6 s-1 until macroscopic failure occurred or a significant amount of post peak-stress axial strain was recorded (between 2% and 5%). We note that one test was conducted at the higher temperature of T=120\u00b0C with a result within 2.5% of the strength at T=60\u00b0C (Table 1). As this is below the expected sample-to-sample variability, no further temperature studies were conducted. The axial load, axial load actuator displacement, axial stress (s1), differential stress (Q=s1 - s3), confining pressure Pc (= s2= s3), confining pressure actuator displacement, axial strain (eax), circumferential strain (ecirc) and temperature were monitored throughout at sampling frequencies of 1s and 0.5kN.

The rates for the segments are averages based on measurements at the ends of each segment.\nThe major fault trace segments also have slip-rates (slip_rate) and extension-rates (ext_rate or extension_) in mm\/yr. All rates as well as the names for major faults can be located in the attribute table of the shape files along with X- and Y-coordinates. The coordinate system is WGS84 UTM Zone 34N. \nThe shape files can be loaded into a GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS etc.) allowing mapping and visualization of the fault traces and their activity rates. \nIn addition, the attribute tables are .dbf files found within each folder.

        "description": "The dataset contains data from a dual experiment conducted to study (i) the stress dependence of ultrasonic (elastic) waves and permeability of salt rocks, and (ii) the dissolution of an intact and a cracked halite samples using geophysical methods.\n\nThe tests were run in the high-pressure room-temperature (20\u00b0C) experimental setup for flow-through tests at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) (Falcon et al. 2016). The rig consists of a triaxial vessel equipped with (i) ultrasonic sensors that allow measuring P- and S-wave velocities and their attenuation factors using the pulse echo method (McCann and Sothcott, 1992), and (ii) two rigs of electrodes embedded into the rubber sleeve of the pressure vessel for collecting electrical resistivity data that can be used to build up an electrical tomography of the sample (North el al. 2013). The rig has automatic control of both confining and pore pressure (ISCO EX-100D system). For the operating conditions and in homogeneous samples, the bulk electrical resistivity error is <1% for bulk resistivities <100 \u03a9 m, increasing up to 5% with the degree of heterogeneity and above this resistivity value, at frequencies 1\u2013500 Hz (North et al., 2013). Regarding the ultrasonic data, the technique and instrumentation used in this experiment provide velocity precision of \u00b1 0.1% and accuracy of \u00b1 0.3% (95% confidence), and attenuation accuracy of \u00b1 0.1 dB cm-1 within the frequency range 300-1000 kHz (Best, 1992). The dataset presented here show the ultrasonic data at a single frequency of 600 kHz, obtained from Fourier analysis of broadband signals. \n\nPermeability to water and to N2 can be both determined with the aid of integrated flowmeters and pore pressure sensors both up- and downstream of the rock sample. \n\nThe rock samples include: Pre-Cambrian salt (unknown well, Pakistan (source: www.likit.co.uk\/)), Cambrian salt (unknown well, Tunguska Basin, Russia), Triassic salt (Arm Hill #1 well, NW Lancashire, UK), and Messinian salt (3A GN3 S02 well, core # 19, near Marianopoli, Sicily). 2.5 cm length, 5 cm diameter core plugs were extracted from precursor rocks, composition estimated by X-ray diffraction analysis, and connected porosity by He-pycnometry.\n\n   Falcon-Suarez, I., North, L., Amalokwu, K., Best, A., 2016.

These are provided \"as-is\" and are not guaranteed to be reproducible within this environment. For external GitHub locations, check out the relevant repository READMEs. Within the processing chain, every notebook is prefixed by a number. To reproduce all results in the chapter, the notebooks should be run in numerical order, because some later things depend on earlier things (historical temperature attribution requires a constrained ensemble of the two layer climate model, which relies on the generation of the radiative forcing time series). This being said, most notebooks should run standalone, as input data is provided where the datasets are small enough (see the 'master;' GitHub page for these). --------------------------------------------------- Sources of additional information --------------------------------------------------- The following weblinks are provided in the Related Documents section of this catalogue record: - Link to the report component containing the figure (Chapter 7) - Link to the Supplementary Material for Chapter 7, which contains details on the input data used in Table 7.SM.1 to 7.SM.7. - Link to the Jupyter notebook for plotting the figure from the Chapter 7 GitHub repository - Link to the code for the figure, archived on Zenodo.",

Assessment methods: - Process understanding - Instrumental record - Paleoclimates - Emergent constraints - Combined assessment - CMIP6 ESMs Assessed ranges are taken from Tables 7.13 and 7.14 for ECS and TCR respectively. Note that for the ECS assessment based on both the instrumental record and paleoclimates, limits (i.e., one-sided distributions) are given, which have twice the probability of being outside the maximum\/minimum value at a given end, compared to ranges (i.e., two-tailed distributions) which are given for the other lines of evidence. For example, the extremely likely limit of greater than 95% probability corresponds to one side of the very likely (5\u201395%) range. Best estimates are given as either a single number or by a range represented by a grey box. CMIP6 model values are not directly used as a line of evidence but presented on the Figure for comparison.

Non-CO2 WMGHGs are further broken down into contributions from methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halogenated compounds. Surface albedo is broken down into land-use changes and light-absorbing particles on snow and ice. Aerosols are broken down into contributions from aerosol\u2013cloud interactions (ERFaci) and aerosol\u2013radiation interactions (ERFari). For aerosols and solar, the 2019 single-year values are given (Table 7.8), which differ from the headline assessments in both cases. Volcanic forcing is not shown due to the episodic nature of volcanic eruptions.

The GNSS\/INS buoys were deployed on sea ice during the 2019-20 MOSAiC expedition. These buoys recorded raw GNSS\/INS data at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. For the kinematic correction, two buoys (with overlapping measurements of each other) were selected, and one of the buoys was used as a moving \"base\" and the other as the \"rover\". The post-processed dataset contains kinematically corrected latitude, longitude and velocity of the rover, as well as the baseline distance between the rover and base. The main objective of the kinematic correction is to create high-precision and high-frequency data to measure ice dynamics at a few centimetre accuracies. The buoys were assembled by the University of Huddersfield team and the deployment was done by the MOSAiC ice team throughout the expedition.

Each sample was taken to 5% axial strain at a starting effective stress equivalent to 85% of its hydrostatic yield (P*) value, which were identified from yield under hydrostatic loading. These data for the 3 samples are presented as matlab data files. Post-deformation, each of the 3 cores underwent backscatter SEM and subsequent image analysis to examine any localised variations in porosity and grain size. These data are presented as csv files. Discrete bands form in each of the 3 sandstones but are distributed differently across each sample. Our results suggest that cement type plays a significant role in the micromechanics of deformation within each of the sandstones, which in turn, determines where the compaction bands nucleate and develop. These results may provide a starting point to investigate the role of cement on compaction localisation further.",

        "description": "Terrestrial palaeo-environmental proxy data has been collected to examine orbital changes in wildfire activity in the Early Jurassic of the Mochras Borehole, Cardigan Bay Basin, Wales. To do this a high resolution charcoal abundance dataset was created and quantified in two size fractions, microscopic charcoal (10-125 \u00b5) and macroscopic charcoal (>125 \u00b5). To take potential changes in riverine influx and\/or organic preservation in account on the charcoal abundance, palynofacies were analysed to document all terrestrial and marine organic particles present in the samples, and next to this, X-ray fluorescence data was gathered to assess detrital output. Mass spectrometry provided information on the carbonate and Total Organic Carbon content and bulk organic carbon isotopes. This information was used to look at changes in the lithology and the carbon cycle. Finally, clay mineralogical data was obtained to look at changes in the hydrological cycle in relation to wildfire activity.\nThis dataset spans 951-934 mbs from the Mochras borehole, which is the time equivalent of ~350 kyr, in the Margaritatus Zone of the Upper Pliensbachian. The Mochras sediments have been deposited in the Cardigan Bay Basin, Wales. At the time of deposition, this location was positioned in the Laurasian Seaway at a paleolatitude of ~35\u00b0N.\nThese datasets were obtained at a high resolution (10 cm) using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, mass spectrometry and palynological preparations. This high resolution was acquired to analyse the presence of precessional orbital forcing on wildfire and the other proxy datasets. \nThis data was collected, interpreted and analysed by Teuntje Hollaar, Claire Belcher, Stephen Hesselbo, Micha Ruhl, Jean-Fran\u04abois Deconinck, Sarah Jane Baker and Luke Mander.

        "description": "This work presents a detailed three-dimensional finite element based model for wave propagation, combined with a postprocessing procedure to determine the fracture intensity caused by blasting. The data generated during this project includes output files of all simulations with detailed fields, geometries and meshes. The model incorporates the Johnson-Holmquist-2 constitutive model, which is designed for brittle materials undergoing high strain rates and high pressures and fracturing, and a tensile failure model. Material heterogeneity is introduced into the model through variation of the material properties at the element level, ensuring jumps in strain. The algorithm for the combined Johnson-Holmquist-2 and tensile failure model is presented and is demonstrated to be energy-conserving, with an open-source MATLAB implementation of the model. A range of sub-scale numerical experiments are performed to validate the modelling and postprocessing procedures, and a range of materials, explosive waves and geometries are considered to demonstrate the model's predictive capability quantitatively and qualitatively for fracture intensity. Fracture intensities on 2D planes and 3D volumes are presented. The mesh dependence of the method is explored, demonstrating that mesh density changes maintain similar results and improve with increasing mesh quality. Damage patterns in simulations are self-organising, forming thin, planar, fracture-like structures that closely match the observed fractures in the experiments. The presented model is an advancement in realism for continuum modelling of blasts as it enables fully three-dimensional wave interaction, handles damage due to both compression and tension, and relies only on measurable material properties. The uploaded data are the specific simulation outputs for four explosion models occurring on two different rock types, and the specific fracture patterns generated.",

The samples are from the following formations:\nA3 Fort Simpson, A6 Fort Simpson, D1 Muskwa, A16 Otter Park, and A20 Evie.\t\nThe data is in two sets. Set 1 includes nanoindentation data from all samples, with grids conducted both parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. In Set 2, additional chemical analysis of select grids (on samples A3, A6 and A20) was undertaken using SEM\/EDS. Both sets include the following tab-separated .txt files:\ngrid_para.txt [Load-displacement-time data for each indent (parallel indentation)]; grid_para_summary.txt [Reduced elastic modulus, hardness and creep modulus for each indent (parallel indentation)]; grid_perp.txt [Load-displacement-time data for each indent (perpendicular indentation)]; grid_perp_summary.txt [Reduced elastic modulus, hardness and creep modulus data for each indent (parallel indentation)].\nSet 2 also includes .tif files containing SEM images and EDS chemical analysis of the grids. \nThe data has been filtered to remove indents which show 'pop-in' behaviour or time-displacement curves that do not conform to a logarithmic fit.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT -\nThe authors wish to thank the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for funding this research through the SHAPE-UK project (grant numbers NE\/R018057\/1, NE\/R017840\/1, and NE\/R017565\/1), which forms Challenge 3 of the UKUH (Unconventional Hydrocarbons in the UK Energy System) programme.",

        "description": "The dataset contains 12 new Be-10 cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure ages. The samples were collected from a scoria cone 1.5 km west of Mt. Murphy an exposed volcanic edifice adjacent to Pope Glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, Antarctica. Samples of erratic cobbles which showed evidence of transport by ice were collected over the 2015-2016 AmuNdsen Sea Embayment Exposure Dating (ANISEED) Field Season, prepared at the CosmIC laboratory, Imperial College London and measured for Be-10 at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. Beryllium-10 concentrations were measured by Accelerated Mass Spectrometry (AMS). Samples were measured to determine timing of deglaciation of two rock outcrops to better constrain the ice sheet lowering history of Pope Glacier during the Holocene. Study forms part of the wider International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration Project (ITGC). Samples were collected by Dr. Joanne Johnson and Dr. Stephen Roberts (British Antarctic Survey), supported by field assistants Alistair Docherty and Iain Rudkin.

        "description": "A new monthly long term average (climatology) of Leaf Area Index (LAI) has been developed for use as ancillary data with the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) Land Surface Model and the UK Met Office Unified Model. It is derived from an improved version of long time series of LAI from the original Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products (http:\/\/www.glass.umd.edu\/LAI\/MODIS\/0.05D\/). The GLASS data consists of a time series of LAI from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface-reflectance data for the period 2000-2014. The MODIS data was provided in a spatial resolution of 1km in a sinusoidal projection and is interpolated into 0.5deg on a geographic latitude\/longitude projection in this dataset. The total LAI from MODIS is segregated into five different Plant Functional Types (PFTs) using the fractional coverage of each PFT from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover data. For this reason this new LAI climatology should be used in combination with the CCI PFT data, which is also provided here. Two variables are provided with the dataset containing LAI, each covering the same spatial and time extent. The PFT data provided with this dataset covers a time span of only one year, 2010. - Leaf Area Index (LAI) - LAI is an important parameter in land-surface models, influencing the surface roughness, transpiration rate and the soil water content and temperature. Numerous outputs of vegetation models such as net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), light absorption by plants (FAPAR), nutrient dynamics etc., are influenced by LAI where it is a key variable in energy and water balance calculations. - Vegetation Canopy Height (H) - H plays an important role in the interface between the atmosphere and land surface and it impacts weather and climate at local to global scales by modulating aerodynamic conductance and vegetation dynamics. Therefore, H is fundamentally needed for the calculation of turbulent exchanges of energy and mass between the atmosphere and the terrestrial ecosystem. One variable is provided with the dataset containing CCI PFTs: - Fractional coverage of 5 PFTS or vegetation classes and 4 land use classes \u2013 The 5 PFTs are Broad Leaf, Needle Leaf, C3 Grass, C4 Grass and Shrub. The 4 land use classes are Urban area, Inland Water, Bare Soil and Snow\/Ice.",

        "title": "Micromechanics of shear failure in a porous rock: a combined dataset of high-resolution time-resolved 3D x-ray micro-tomography volumes and local 3D strain fields with contemporaneous acoustic emissions and ultrasonic velocity survey waveforms",
        "description": "This dataset shows both the micro-scale mechanisms and acoustic response involved in shear failure of a deforming porous rock. To our knowledge, this is the first such dataset to combine simultaneous acoustic measurements and x-ray tomography imaging. It comprises a time-series of 3D in-situ synchrotron x-ray microtomography (\u00b5CT) volumes showing a Clashach sandstone sample (CL10) undergoing triaxial deformation to failure under a constant acoustic emissions (AE) event rate. Use of a constant AE event rate slowed down the failure process after peak stress, enabling shear failure to be captured in unprecedented spatio-temporal detail by the \u00b5CT volumes. These volumes are accompanied by the local incremental 3D strain fields and simultaneously acquired waveforms from acoustic emissions and ultrasonic velocity surveys, as well as mechanical bulk stress and strain. These data are fully explained in Cartwright-Taylor et al. Seismic events miss important grain-scale mechanisms governed by kinematics during shear failure of porous rock, in review at Nature Communications. We also include an equivalent time-series of the same data types showing a second Clashach sandstone sample (CL04) undergoing triaxial deformation to failure, this time under a constant strain rate where failure happened abruptly, shortly after peak stress. Both collections were acquired in-situ on the beamline I12-JEEP at the Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK, in September 2019. Each 3D \u00b5CT volume of the sample is contained in a .zip file labelled with the sequential scan number. Each volume comprises reconstructed 16-bit grey-scale data in a sequence of 2D image files (.tif), each numbered according to the depth at which it lies within the sample volume. The file dimensions are pixels, with an edge length of 7.91 \u00b5m. Two further .zip files contain the incremental 3D volumetric and deviatoric strain fields, obtained from digital volume correlation between neighbouring \u00b5CT volumes. Each strain field consists of a 32-bit 3D image file (.tif) in pixels with an edge length of 316.4 \u00b5m, labelled with its scan increment. Also included are (i) .csv files, containing the mechanical stress and strain time-series, the time and mechanical data at which each \u00b5CT volume was scanned, and the acoustic emissions event rate data, and (ii) .zip files containing times and waveforms for the acoustic emissions and ultrasonic velocity surveys as .ascii files. The .zip and .xlsx files are labelled with the sample name, the data type (grey-scale, strain-volumetric, strain-deviatoric, seismic, mechanical, mechCT, eventrateAE) and the sequential scan number (grey-scale only) according to the following convention: sample_datatype_scan#.

In October 2020, 48 anemones were collected at low tide by hand from Corbyn Head, Torquay, South Devon UK. A further 40 capture-bred anemones where collected from the Horniman Museum Aquarium, London, UK. Eight individual anemones were analysed for their microplastic contamination levels from the field. The remaining 80 were used to investigate the uptake of microplastics and the influence of food and temperature on that uptake. Anemones were digested after exposure or collection from the environment and the plastics enumerated. The environmental microplastics were also scored for the size, shape, colour. Their polymer was identified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. This work was undertaken by scientists at the University of Exeter as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) project MINIMISE (Current and Future Effects of Microplastics on Marine Shelf Ecosystems), funded under grant reference NE\/S003975\/1. MINIMISE aims to determine how microplastics and contaminants affect the functioning of marine shelf seas sediments and the organisms that live in them under different ocean chemistry conditions.

        "description": "The measurements and data contained here were obtained to study the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks, and more specifically the oxidation of rock organic carbon and the associated release of CO2. The primary aim was to better understand the production and mobility of the trace element rhenium during weathering, because this element has been proposed as a proxy for rock organic carbon oxidation. \nThe study focused on three Alpine catchments that drain sedimentary rocks, which all experience moderate to high erosion rates where oxidative weathering rates are thought to operate faster. Two catchments were located in Switzerland - the Erlenbach and Vogelbach, and one catchment in Colorado, USA - the East River. To study chemical weathering and the production and mobility of rhenium, a suite of samples were collected to capture the source and products of weathering reactions. These focused on stream and river water, river sediments and weathering profiles collected on sedimentary rocks.\nThe Swiss catchments, water samples were collected from 2011 and 2012 to capture changes in river flow and seasonal changes in hydro-climate. Samples were collected from a gauging station operated by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research - WSL. In the East River, samples were collected from the gauging station operated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area from 2015 and 2016. Additional samples included snow samples collected from the Erlenbach. \nAll water samples were analysed for their major dissolved ion content by Ion Chromatography. Dissolved rhenium concentrations were determined by High Resolution and Quadrupole Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Solid samples were digested and analysed for Re content by ICP-MS. These geochemical measurements were paired with water discharge data to quantify the flux of dissolved elements, using rating curves and flux-weighted average methods, and interpret the hydrological context of ion production and mobility through the landscape.\nThis new data acquisition was funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant to Robert Hilton (ROC-CO2 project, grant 678779) and a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK, Standard Grant (NE\/I001719\/1).\nFurther details of subsequent data analysis and interpretation can be found in Hilton, R.G., et al., 2021, Concentration-discharge relationships of dissolved rhenium in Alpine catchments reveal its use as a tracer of oxidative weathering, Water Resources Research",

        "description": "Compositional and volcanological data from a small-volume explosive-effusive volcanic eruption on Ascension Island, South Atlantic. Multiple samples of pumice and lava spanning the whole eruption sequence were collected from several locations in the area surrounding NE-Bay on Ascension Island. This dataset includes compositional, clast size, abundance, clast density and vesicle texture data for the products of the Echo Canyon eruption. Data was collected between the 12th June 2018 and the 30th August 2020 on Ascension Island and at the University of East Anglia, UK. Compositional data was collected using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), density of pumice clasts using the Archimedes suspension method and textural data by visual inspection of sample vesicle shape and size, all at the University of East Anglia, UK. Clast size and abundance was semi-quantitatively estimated in the field on Ascension Island and later checked against photographs. This data provides a framework through which changes to eruption style were reconstructed and is useful to any persons wishing to study or compare small-volume eruption deposits which record eruptive transitions. The data supports and forms the basis of Davies et al., (2021) (DOI : 10.1007\/s00445-021-01480-1) and forms part of B V Davies\u2019 Natural Environment Research Council funded PhD project investigating eruption controls on Ascension Island. Bridie V Davies collected and interpreted the data with assistance from Jane H Scarrow and Richard J Brown on Ascension Island, and Jenni Barclay at the University of East Anglia, Bertrand Leze performed XRF on prepared samples.

        "title": "Carbon dioxide flux and isotopic composition from sedimentary rock weathering, Draix-Bleone Critical Zone Observatory, France",
        "description": "The measurements and data contained here were obtained to study the release of carbon dioxide during the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks. The primary aim of the research was to explore how these CO2 fluxes were related to environmental parameters (temperature, hydrology). Weathering of sedimentary rocks can result in CO2 release from the oxidation of rock organic carbon oxidation, but also due to the oxidation of sulfide minerals, production of sulfuric acid and subsequent release of CO2 from carbonate minerals. These rock-derived carbon sources are understudied, and form an important part of the geological carbon cycle. The CO2 flux measurements were made on 5 rock chambers (H4, H6, H7, H8 and H13) installed in the Draix-Bleone Critical Zone Observatory, France, on outcrops of Jurassic marls. Measurements and data were collected from December 2016 to May 2019. Regular visits to the site (~4 per year) returned data on total CO2 flux (see data in Total-CO2-flux.csv). This was explored as a function of temperature and ambient hydroclimate (precipitation). The datasets include the total CO2 flux measured at each visit to a chamber, and measurements of the internal chamber temperature. To determine the source of CO2 measured in the chambers, we trapped the CO2 using zeolite sieves and recovered it in the laboratory. The radiocarbon activity (reported as fraction modern, F14C) and its stable isotope composition (d13C) were measured from CO2 collected from chambers H4 and H6 over the sampling period (Radiocarbon-data.csv). These measurements were used in a mixing analysis to partition the source of CO2 between rock organic carbon and carbonate using a mixing model approach (Partitioned-CO2-fluxes.csv), as explained in full detail in the published paper Soulet et al., 2021, Nature Geoscience. We also measured the geochemical characteristics of the bedrocks that are undergoing weathering at the field site (rock-geochemical-composition.csv), including the organic carbon concentration, inorganic carbon concentration and their isotopic composition, and sulfur concentration. Finally, we measured environmental variables of interest: the chamber temperature (chamber-temperature.csv) and the air temperature at the Draix-Bleone observatory (Air-temperature-at-laval-le-plateau-weather-station.csv, respectively). This research was funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant to Robert Hilton (ROC-CO2 project, grant 678779) and Radiocarbon and stable isotope measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK, (NERC National Environmental Isotope Facility NEIF Radiocarbon Allocation 2074.1017) to Guillaume Soulet, Robert Hilton and Mark Garnett.

        "title": "APHH: Non-methane volatile organic compound emission inventories from burning studies performed as part of the APHH-INDIA project (DelhiFlux).",
        "description": "This contains gridded non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emission inventories for India derived as part of burning studies performed during the APHH-INDIA campaign. For data files with more than 1 million rows, NASA AMES metadata headers have been provided as a separate document, which has the identical name of the data it applies to but also includes _metadata. For years 1993, 1994, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2016 inventories have been produced in terms of total NMVOC emission from each source sector (kg\/km2). There are also two upper limit scenarios of emissions from cow dung cake combustion based on data from PPAC and PPAC supplemented with additional cow dung cake consumption for states now covered by this survey. The speciation factors of NMVOCs released from particular sources are also provided so that these years can be speciated by source simply by multiplying the total emission from each source by the ratio of species released from the source. This allows future users to produce speciated emission inventories for years other than 2011 if they need. Gridded inventories are also provided for emissions of 21 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for the year 2011 from fuelwood, cow dung cake, charcoal, liquefied petroleum gas and municipal solid waste. These are provided as total PAH emissions from a source with speciation factors also provided to allow speciation should it be required by multiplying the total NMVOC emission from a source by the speciation factors from that source. Gridded inventories are provided for crop residue burning at 1km2 and 10km2. These were calculated with total agricultural area identified in a state from either NASA MODIS (1 km2) or Ramankutty et al. (2008) (10 km2). A second inventory was produced at 10km2 as it was felt that the NASA data offered little variation within respective states. These have been split into total emissions from each of the 5 emission factors applied, RiceEFyearlyVOCKG (for rice), WheatEFyearlyVOCKG (for wheat, coarse cereal and maize), JowarEFyearlyVOCKG (for Jowar and Bajra), MeanEFyearlyVOCKG (for 9 oilseeds, groundnut, rapeseed, mustard, sunflower, cotton, jute and mesta) and SugarcaneEFyearlyVOCKG (for sugarcane). The inventories were produced using emission factors developed as part of the APHH-INDIA project as well as from a different publication focussed on the burning of crops. The inventories have been developed in the following manner. The emission factors used in this study come from a variety of recently published sources. All emission factors applied in this study included measurement by PTR-ToF-MS, a technique well suited to species released in significant quantities from solid fuel combustion such as small oxygenated species, phenolics and furanics. These species are often missed by GC measurement alone. Preference has been given to emission factors from studies which: (1) have many measurements (n), (2) use samples collected from India or (3) use samples collected from similar countries. Fully speciated emission factors are available from the references given. For residential fuel combustion, the emission factors measured by Stewart et al. (2021a) were used and were developed from 76 combustion experiments of fuel wood, cow dung cake, LPG and MSW samples collected from around Delhi. This study was extremely detailed and measured online, gas-phase, speciated NMVOC emission factors for up to 192 chemical species using dual-channel gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (DC-GC-FID, n = 51), two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC\u00d7GC-FID, n = 74), proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS, n = 75) and solid-phase extraction two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SPE-GC\u00d7GC-ToF-MS, n = 28). Comparison of these emission factors to those obtained in similar studies is provided in Stewart et al. (2021a). The emission factors used as part of this study are larger than those measured by Stockwell et al. (2016), Fleming et al. (2018) and several other studies which were based on gas chromatography techniques alone. The emission factors here measure many more NMVOC species, use techniques which target a range of species which more traditional GC analyses do not detect and make online measurements which minimise loss of intermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic species, which may be lost through the collection of whole air samples, but have been shown to represent a large proportion of total emissions from biomass burning (Stockwell et al., 2015). Emission factors for combustion of crop residues on fields were taken from measurements by Stockwell et al. (2015) made using PTR-ToF-MS of 115 NMVOCs (Stockwell et al., 2015) for wheat straw (n = 6), sugarcane (n=2), rice straw (n=7) and millet (n=2). This study also included the mean crop residue emission factor for 19 food crops, for use when no current emission factor had been comprehensively measured using PTR-ToF-MS. The emission factor applied (38.8 g kg-1) was evaluated against that for crop residues used for domestic combustion in Delhi (37.9 g kg-1). Whilst the values measured by Stockwell et al. (2015) and Stewart et al. (2021a) were comparable, the value from Stockwell et al. (2015) was used as the crop types were more reflective of the crop residues burnt on fields after harvest, compared to those burnt to meet residential energy requirements. The mean emission factor for crop residue combustion on fields was used for specific crop types with smaller levels of cultivation. Emissions from coal burning were estimated using a mean emission factor from the combustion of bituminous coal from China (n = 14), a neighbouring Asian country, made using PTR-ToF-MS. Whilst the chemical composition of the coal may be more important than the development status of the country, there was overall a low level of reported residential coal use and this estimate was included for completeness. A total of 89 NMVOCs were identified, which represented 90-96% of the total mass spectra (Cai et al., 2019). Indian specific PAH emission factors were recently measured in gas- and particle-phases using PTR-ToF-MS and GC\u00d7GC-ToF-MS (Stewart et al., 2021). This dataset provided PAH emission factors collected from combustion of fuel wood (n = 16), cow dung cake (n = 3), crop residue from domestic combustion (n = 3), MSW (n = 3), LPG (n = 1) and charcoal (n = 1) samples. High resolution, gridded population data for India (WorldPop, 2017) was used at a resolution of 1 km2. Officially, urban populations in India are defined as having a population density &gt; 400 people km-2, 75% of men employed in non-agricultural industries and a population of town &gt; 5000 people. Rural populations in India cannot be identified simply by having a population density of &lt; 400 people km-2, as some states such as Uttar Pradesh have an average population density of around 800 people km-2. Rural grid squares were therefore identified by calculating the population density threshold in each state in which the sum of the 1km2 grid squares below this threshold correctly reproduced the rural populations in these states from the 2001 and 2011 censuses (Government of India, 2014). A small uncertainty existed over the exact population of India and we used population statics indicated by the 2011 census. NMVOC and PAH emissions from domestic solid fuel combustion were plotted against this high-resolution population data in the R statistical programming language at 1 km2 for 2001 and 2011, with the population datasets scaled to the percentage changes in Indian population indicated by the World Bank for additional years of interest. Preference was given to large fuel usage surveys which included tens to hundreds of thousands of respondents. The Household Consumption of Goods and Services in India survey by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO, 2007a, 2012a, 2014) gave state-wise kg capita-1 fuel wood, LPG, charcoal and coal burning statistics for rural and urban environments and was used for the years 2004-2005, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012. NMVOC emissions for these years were calculated by multiplying the NMVOC emission factor for the fuel, by the yearly fuel consumption per capita by the population of the grid cell. Data were collected from additional large surveys previously conducted. These surveys collected data in terms of the number of households using specific fuels per 1000 households in different Indian states in rural and urban environments. The Fifth Quinquennial Survey on Consumer Expenditure provided data for 1993-1994 (NSSO, 1997), the Energy Sources of Indian Households for Cooking and Lighting provided data for years 2004-2005, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 (NSSO, 2007b, 2012b, 2015) and the Household Consumer Expenditure and Employment-Unemployment Situation in India for 2002 and 2006-2007 (NSSO, 2003, 2008). The National Family Health Survey presented India-wide fuel use as a percentage of the population. To reflect spatial variation in fuel use, the raw data from these surveys were accessed (from the DHS Programme, U.S. Agency for International Development), extracted through the SPSS statistics software package and processed in the R programming language. This increased fuel usage data availability as the number of households per 1000 households using specific fuels in Indian states and covered the years 1992-1993, 1998-1999, 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 (International Institute for Population Sciences, 1995, 2000, 2007, 2017). These were extensive datasets with 1992-1993, 1998-1999 and 2005-2006 surveying just under 100,000 households and 2015-2016 around 600,000 households. To allow the incorporation of data from years which were based on the number of households using a particular fuel per 1000 households (1993, 1994, 1999, 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2016), a scaling factor was developed. The scaling factor was based on the ratio of fuel use in the state from years where per capita data was available. It was possible to link the Household Consumption of Goods and Services in India and the Energy Sources of Indian Households for Cooking and Lighting surveys for the years 2005, 2010 and 2011. This was done using years where the number of households per 1000 households and kg capita-1 fuel usage statistics were available, as it was possible to calculate the amount of fuel a primary user would use. The fuel use of a primary user here was defined as the amount of fuel a person would burn who was recorded to use a specific fuel type. For example, if the per capita consumption in the Household Consumption of Goods and Services survey in India for fuel wood was 10 kg per capita per 30 days, and the Energy Sources of Indian Households for Cooking and Lighting survey showed 250 households per 1000 households used fuel wood, then the fuel use was estimated to be 40 kg per primary user per 30 days. This was achieved by multiplying the per capita usage for a particular fuel type by the inverse of the ratio of fuel usage in that state in rural or urban environments. The amount of fuel a primary user would use was then used to estimate the amount of fuel consumed per capita in years where only usage per 1000 household statistics were available. Cow dung cake consumption was only reported as number of households per 1000 in these surveys and the amount of cow dung cake burnt per primary user was determined based on the energy density compared to fuel wood. This was done using calorimetry data which showed that cow dung cake was 1.3-1.9 times less efficient than fuel wood (EPA, 2000; Gadi et al., 2012). For this reason, the amount of fuel per primary user for fuel wood in a state has been multiplied by 1.6 to give the equivalent amount of cow dung cake a user would need to burn for their cooking needs. Upper and lower estimates for cow dung cake consumption were based on the range 1.3-1.9. This was then converted to fuel use per capita in kg per user per 30 days by rearranging E2. This has been evaluated to validate this approach, which estimated Indian cow dung cake consumption to be in the range 25.7-79.7 Tg yr-1 from 1993-2016. This was generally towards the lower end of consumption values previously reported of 35-128 Tg yr-1 (Habib et al., 2004). For this reason, emission inventory estimates were also compared to those produced using cow dung cake consumption based on the TERI Energy Data Directory and Yearbook (TEDDY) 2012\/2013 data and a study from the Petroleum Planning &amp; Analysis Cell (PPAC) from 2016 with population indicated at the 2011 level (TEDDY, 2012; PPAC, 2016). The amount of MSW burnt was estimated using an established approach (IPCC, 2006; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014) with revised inputs for India based on per capita MSW generation from over 300 Indian cities (Annepu et al., 2012), state wise MSW collection figures (CPCB, 2013) as well as estimates of the amount of urban (NEERI, 2010) and rural MSW burnt (World Bank, 2012). This estimate does not include incineration for electrical power generation. Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) assessed worldwide emissions from MSW burning based on IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 2006). The approach used here was similar, with modifications to the input data which made them more specific to India. The approach split the amount of MSW burnt into the MSW burnt by rural and urban populations in the country. For rural populations this was given by per capita rural MSW generation multiplied by the population of rural grid cell multiplied by the fraction of MSW burnt residentially. Per capita rural MSW generation was set at the lower limit indicated by the World Bank for South Asia of 0.12 kg capita-1 day-1 and evaluated in the range 0.08 kg capita-1 day-1 (Parmar and Pamnani, 2018) to 0.12 kg capita-1 day-1 (World Bank, 2012). The fraction of MSW burnt rurally was set to 0.6 which was the IPCC estimate (IPCC, 2006) and was further supported by a recent study which showed that only around 40% of rural MSW was collected in South Asia (Kaza et al., 2018). The fraction of MSW burnt for an urban population was estimated by the sum of two calculations. The first was for street MSW burning which was calculated by per capita urban MSW generation multiplied by the population of urban grid cell multiplied by the fraction of MSW which was not collected multiplied by the fraction burnt. The weighted per capita urban MSW generation was calculated by averaging per capita MSW generation statistics from 366 Indian cities by state (Annepu et al., 2012). The fraction of MSW which was uncollected was calculated from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), as the difference in the amount of MSW generated and collected (CPCB, 2013). Urban per capita MSW generation was scaled to its estimated change for different years of interest. The second calculation was for the MSW burnt on landfill sites, which was calculated by the MSW per capita produced in urban environments, multiplied by the urban population, multiplied by the fraction collected in an urban environment multiplied by the fraction burnt at the landfill site. The fraction of MSW collected came from CPCB statistics, but was reduced by 17-50% due to the informal recycling sector, based on very limited data from studies focussed on MSW recovery by the informal sector which showed 17% recovery in Delhi (Talyan et al., 2008), 20% recovery at a landfill site in Pune (Annepu et al., 2012), 4% in Pondicherry (Rajamanikam et al., 2014) and up to 40-50% in Mohali (Nandy et al., 2015). This was due to the large contribution of the informal recycling sector to recycling in India, where waste was collected by waste merchants, garbage collectors and waste pickers from highways, waste depots and landfill sites. This was an important consideration in India as studies have shown recovery of between 8.5-80 kg of material per picker per day and large cities such as Delhi having 80,000-100,000 pickers (Nandy et al., 2015). The fraction of waste burnt in a dump (Bfrac,dump) was given by NEERI who estimated that 10% of landfill MSW in Mumbai was burnt (NEERI, 2010). This was reinforced by a further study which examined the amount of waste burnt based on satellite studies of a landfill site in India which showed that approximately 10% of the waste that entered the site each day ended up being burnt (Sharma et al., 2019). Bfrac,dump was notably lower here (0.1) than in Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) (0.6) which was based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. The estimate used in this study represented a conservative estimate of NMVOC emissions from landfill fires. Due to lack of reliable data in establishing Bfrac,dump, and the associated uncertainty, the sensitivity of urban landfill burning emissions over the range 0.1-0.6 was evaluated as part of the uncertainty range given in this study. This provided the upper limit to the uncertainty range of the potential amount of landfill waste burnt. This depicts scenarios before the new MSW management rules in 2016. NMVOC emissions from crop residue burning on fields in India were estimated to evaluate the relative importance of different burning sources using the most up-to-date input data currently available. A calculation was carried out for 2011, as NMVOC emissions from crop-residue burning on fields showed little year-on-year variation from 1995-2009 (Jain et al., 2014). The residue generated from the cultivation of four main categories of crops was estimated. The amount of crop types produced in each state (Ministry of Agriculture, 2012) was collated for cereals (rice, wheat, coarse cereals, maize, jowar, bajra), oilseeds (groundnut, rapeseed, mustard, sunflower and 9 oilseeds), fibres (cotton, jute and mesta) and sugarcane. The amount burnt was calculated using India specific estimates of the residue to crop ratio, dry matter fraction and fraction burnt (Jain et al., 2014). Emissions were estimated using factors from recent studies of crop residues routinely burnt on fields using PTR-ToF-MS (Stockwell et al., 2015). When the exact residue was measured (e.g., rice straw, wheat straw, sugarcane and millet) the correct emission factor was used. For cases where the exact residue was not measured, the mean reported crop residue emission factor was used. The spatial distribution of croplands was then either indicated using agricultural land identified by the high-resolution 500 m NASA MODIS land use product reduced to 1 km2 resolution or through croplands identified at 10 km2 through evaluation of the distribution of agricultural lands (Ramankutty et al., 2008). The total amount of crop residue burnt in a state was calculated using the approach given in Jain et al. (2014) but with the up-to-date inputs discussed. The inventories were produced by Gareth Stewart at the University of York. Full details of the methodology are provided in the publication associated with these inventories. The inventories provided here cover most of the land mass of India, but may vary slightly compared to those presented in the publication. This is associated with the North of India, particularly around the Pakistan and Chinese borders. This is due to how the boundaries of India were defined in the base data used for this study (WorldPop and GADM) and changes to states in the North of India after the period of interest (i.e. formation of Ladakh in 2019). An inventory for coal has not been included due to low total emissions.

The dataset covers Great Britain and is published at 1: 50 000 scale. The content is derived from a range of data sources including, but not limited to the bedrock geology, extensive literature reviews of both published and unpublished documents, abandonment and mine plans, combined with a wealth of expert knowledge and experience. The release of version 8 builds on the content of previously published versions. The coverage has been expanded with the inclusion of newly identified areas and drawing on data from the BGS published Britpits (BGS database of British Pits -includes both surface and underground mineral workings) and other resources. For the first time, zones of influence have been integrated (for evaporites, oil shales and building stones) to indicate the areas surrounding mining sites which might be impacted. The data have been compiled and presented in an easy to use format to provide a national overview of the country's mining legacy. Given the long and complex mining history of Great Britain, this dataset represents the best information available at the time of release (September 2020). Work continues to develop this product, which will result in the release of ad hoc updates in the future.",

Since surface nanobubbles were first imaged in 2000, they have been of growing interest to research due to their long lived properties, with reported lifetimes as long as several hours. Images of nanobubbles were produced under water, collector and depressant conditions using the air water supersaturation method. These are the first images of surface nanobubbles on dolomite. Surface nanobubbles could play a part in the processing of dolomite via froth flotation. These images lay a foundation for future analysis of the effect of nanobubbles in flotation.",

        "description": "The objective of cruise JR15003 in December 2015 was to examine organic matter and nutrient cycling and benthic-pelagic coupling in the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf region using biogeochemical and isotopic measurements of the water column, sediments and porewaters. Samples were collected at three stations at the beginning of the ice-free season, between 25th and 28th December 2015, as part of the Collaborative Gearing Scheme project CGS-109. Water column samples were collected from niskin bottles mounted on the CTD rosette of RRS James Clark Ross and analysed for nutrient and organic matter concentrations and their isotopic signatures, and the oxygen isotope composition of seawater. Temperature, pressure, salinity, and oxygen data from the CTD package are also provided to accompany water column biogeochemistry data. Upper sediment samples were collected by box-coring and subsequent sub-sampling. Interface waters were collected immediately, then sub-cores were taken from the box core for pore fluid extraction and core sectioning. Pore fluids were extracted every two centimetres using rhizon syringe filters with a filter membrane of &lt;0.15 micrometres, and stored for analysis of macronutrient concentrations (ammonium, nitrate+nitrite, nitrite, phosphate, and silicate). Porewaters and water column samples were analysed for macronutrient concentrations at Plymouth Marine Laboratory and seawater oxygen isotopes were analysed at the British Geological Survey, Keyworth. Data were generated by Sian Henley at the School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh, Katharine Hendry at the School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol and Yvonne Firing at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Data collection was funded by the NERC Independent Research Fellowship NE\/K010034\/1 entitled \"Isotopic characterisation of nutrient dynamics and UCDW behaviour in the west Antarctic Peninsula sea ice environment\".

        "description": "We use polarimetric radar sounding to investigate variation in ice crystal orientation fabric within the near-surface (top 40-300 m) of Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica. To assess the influence of the fabric on ice flow, we use an analytical model to derive anisotropic enhancements of the flow law from the fabric measurements. In the shallowest ice (40-100 m) the azimuthal fabric orientation is consistent with flow-induced development and correlates with the surface strain field. Notably, toward the ice-stream margins, both the horizontal compression angle and fabric orientation tend toward 45 degrees relative to ice flow. This result is consistent with theoretical predictions of flow-induced fabric under simple shear, but to our knowledge has never been observed. The fabric orientation in deeper ice (100-300 m) is significantly misaligned with shallower ice in some locations, and therefore inconsistent with the local surface strain field. This result represents a new challenge for ice flow models which typically infer basal properties from the surface conditions assuming simplified vertical variation of ice flow. Our technique retrieves azimuthal variations in fabric but is insensitive to vertical variation, and we therefore constrain the fabric and rheology within two end-members: a vertical girdle or a horizontal pole. Our hypotheses are that fabric near the center of the ice-stream tends to a vertical girdle that enhances horizontal compression, and near the ice-stream margins tends to a horizontal pole that enhances lateral shear.

        "description": "The NERC-funded Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds (MAC) project was centred on an aircraft campaign measuring clouds, aerosols, and boundary layer properties over the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. These data are simulations of the Polar-optimised Weather Research and Forecasting (PWRF) model for 5 configurations of the model's Morrison microphysics scheme, produced for a case study of two separate flights over the same region during the campaign (British Antarctic Survey MASIN twin-otter aircraft flights 218 an 219 on 27th November 2015). Each simulation contains data from two domains - a parent domain with 5km grid size and a nest with a 1km grid size. The control simulation used default physics options in the PWRF model's Morrison microphysics scheme. For the no-threshold, 2xHM, 5xHM, 10xHM simulations, thresholds restricting Hallett-Mossop secondary ice production in the PWRF model's Morrison microphysics scheme were removed, and for the 2xHM, 5xHM, and 10xHM cases the corresponding ice multiplication factor was increased by a factor of 2, 5 or 10. In all simulations, an approximation of the DeMott et al., 2010 (PNAS) parametrization used for primary ice nucleation. Methodology and further details can be found in Young et al., 2019 (Geophysical Research Letters): Radiative effects of secondary ice enhancement in coastal Antarctic clouds.",

        "description": "We imaged the steady-state flow of brine and decane at different fractional flows during dual injection in a micro-porous limestone using X-ray micro-tomography. We applied differential imaging on Estaillades carbonate to (a) distinguish micro-porous regions from macro-pores, and (b) determine fluid phase pore occupancy and relative permeability at a capillary number, Ca = 7.3\u00d710-6. The sample porosity was approximately 28 %, with 7% in macro-pores and 21% in pores that could not be directly resolved (micro-porosity). We find that, in addition to brine and decane, a fraction of the macroscopic pore space contains an intermittent phase, which is occupied either by brine or oil during the hour-long scan time. Furthermore, fluid occupancy in micro-porosity was classified into three sub-phases: micro-pore space with oil, micro-pore space with brine, and micro pores partially filled with oil and brine.",

        "description": "The images in this dataset show the mixing of two liquid solutions in a random bead pack as a function of time and in three-dimensions. The working fluids used in this study are solutions of methanol and ethylene-glycol (MEG, fluid 1) and brine (fluid 2). In particular, three mixtures of ethylene-glycol and methanol were prepared that differ in wt% ethylene-glycol, namely 55 wt% (MEG55), 57 wt% (MEG57) and 59 wt% (MEG59). Measurements are conducted using in the regime of Rayleigh numbers, Ra = 2000-5000. X-ray Computed Tomography is applied to image the spatial and temporal evolution of the solute plume non -invasively. The tomograms are used to compute macroscopic quantities including the rate of dissolution and horizontally averaged concentration profiles, and enable the visualisation of the ow patterns that arise upon mixing at a spatial resolution of about (2x2x2) mm3. We observe that the mixing process evolves systematically through three stages, starting from pure diffusion, followed by convection-dominated and shutdown. A modified diffusion equation is applied to model the convective process with an onset time of convection that compares favourably with literature data and an effective diffusion coefficient that is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusivity of the solute. The comparison of the experimental observations of convective mixing against their numerical counterparts of the purely diffusive scenario enables the estimation of a non-dimensional convective mass flux in terms of the Sherwood number, Sh = 0.025Ra. We observe that the latter scales linearly with Ra, in agreement with observations from both experimental and numerical studies on thermal convection over the same Ra regime.",

        "description": "The images in this dataset are a sample of Bentheimer Sandstone from a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scan acquired with a voxel resolution of 6.00\u00b5m. We imaged the steady state flow of brine and decane in Bentheimer sandstone. We devised an experimental method based on differential imaging to examine how flow rate impacts the pore-scale distribution of fluids during coinjection. This allows us to elucidate flow regimes (connected, or breakup of the nonwetting phase pathways) for a range of fractional flows at two capillary numbers, Ca, namely 3.0E-7 and 7.5E-6. At the lower Ca, for a fixed fractional flow, the two phases appear to flow in connected unchanging subnetworks of the pore space, consistent with conventional theory. At the higher Ca, we observed that a significant fraction of the pore space contained sometimes oil and sometimes brine during the 1 h scan: this intermittent occupancy, which was interpreted as regions of the pore space that contained both fluid phases for some time, is necessary to explain the flow and dynamic connectivity of the oil phase; pathways of always oil-filled portions of the void space did not span the core. This phase was segmented from the differential image between the 30 wt % KI brine image and the scans taken at each fractional flow. Using the grey scale histogram distribution of the raw images, the oil proportion in the intermittent phase was calculated. The pressure drops at each fractional flow at low and high flow rates were measured by high precision differential pressure sensors. The relative permeabilities and fractional flow obtained by our experiment at the mm-scale compare well with data from the literature on cm-scale samples.",

The test was configured to assess geophysical monitoring and deformation of reservoirs subjected to CO2 injection in shallow weakly-cemented (North Sea-like, e.g., Sleipner) CO2 storage sandstone reservoirs. The tests was conducted in the rock physics laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, during 2015-2016, as part of the DiSECCS project with funding from the United Kingdom\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant EP\/K035878\/1) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The experiment was a steady state brine-CO2 flow-through test in which realistic shallow CO2 geosequestration conditions were simulated, to related geophysical signatures to the hydrodynamic and geomechanical behaviour of the rock sample. The confining and pore pressure conditions were similar to those estimated for shallow North Sea Sleipner-like, storage reservoirs, but simulating inflation\/depletion cyclic scenarios for increasing brine:CO2 fractional flow rates. The data include ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and their respective attenuation factors, axial, radial and volumetric strains, and electrical resistivity; also relative permeability to both fluids (CO2 and brine) is displayed as a function of pore volume times, associated to increasing CO2 to brine contents in the sample.",

Filenames contain ice stream code and, in some cases, where the ice stream code is followed by a plus or minus sign, the approximate distance in kilometres upstream from the ice stream's grounding line, although in other cases the number is arbitrary.  The naming convention has been preserved for legacy reasons.  The ice streams are Evans (E &amp; XX), Rutford (R), Institute (IIS), Talutis (T &amp; TT) and Foundation (H) ice streams.\n\nEach GPS unit's data are given in a netCDF4_classic file containing 4 columns: \"Date number\", as the number of days from January 0, 0000 in the proleptic ISO calendar; \"Latitude\" &amp; \"Longitude\", both in decimal degrees in the WGS 1984 EPSG:4326 co-ordinate system; \"height\", in metres above the reference ellipsoid.  The data have been collated from daily files, processed using the Bernese 5.0 software, using precise point positioning at intervals of 30 seconds.  Note that data have not been corrected for inverse barometer or ocean tide loading effects.\n\nThese data were collected as part of a systemic campaign to look for modulation in ice flow through ocean tidal forcing.  The vertical tidal motion of floating ice shelves generates stresses which cause a change in horizontal ice velocity at periods of hours to years. These signals can travel far upstream of ice stream grounding lines and often exhibit a change in frequency from the astronomical tides that generate them. As such, they can act as a natural experiment with which we can learn about ice rheology and subglacial processes.",

One experiment was a steady state brine-CO2 flow-through test (so called BTFT in the spreadsheet) to simultaneously evaluate storage capacity and identify pore fluid distribution and mechanical indicators during CO2 geosequestration. The confining and pore pressure conditions were similar to those estimated for shallow North Sea \u2013 like storage reservoirs, but simulating inflation\/depletion cyclic scenarios for increasing brine:CO2 fractional flow rates. The second experiment focused on the assessment of geomechanical changes (the so called GAT in the spreadsheet) during and after CO2 storage activities under the same stress conditions. The data include ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and their respective attenuation factors and axial and radial strains in both tests, and electrical resistivity in the case of the flow-through test.",

        "description": "This dataset presents monthly gridded sea ice and ocean parameters for the Arctic derived from the European Space Agency's satellite CryoSat-2. Parameters include sea ice freeboard, sea ice thickness, sea ice surface roughness, mean sea surface height, sea level anomaly, and geostrophic circulation. Data are provided as monthly grids with a resolution of 25 km, mapped onto the NSIDC EASE2-Grid, covering the Arctic region north of 50 degrees latitude, for all winter months (Oct-Apr) between 2010 and 2018. CryoSat-2 Level 1b Baseline C observed waveforms have been retracked using a numerical model for the SAR altimeter backscattered echo from snow-covered sea ice presented in Landy et al. (2019), which offers a sophisticated physically-based treatment of the effect of ice surface roughness on retracked ice and ocean elevations. Methods for optimizing echo model fits to observed CryoSat-2 waveforms, retracking waveforms, classifying returns, deriving sea ice freeboard, and converting to thickness are detailed in Landy et al. (In Review). This dataset contains derived sea ice thicknesses from two processing chains, the first using the conventional snow depth and density climatology from Warren et al. (1999) and the second using reanalysis and model-based snow data from SnowModel (Stroeve et al., In Review). Sea surface height and ocean topography grids were derived from only those CryoSat-2 samples classified as leads. Both the random and systematic uncertainties relevant for each parameter have been carefully estimated and are provided in the data files. NetCDF files contain detailed descriptions of each derived parameter.

        "description": "Geochemical data has been collected on samples from new exposures of the 1883 deposits, revealed by the 2018 tsunamigenic flank collapse of Anak Krakatau, which provides improved stratigraphic context. Whole-rock data taken by X-ray Florescence shows no systematic stratigraphic correlation. Chemical data for transects across, and spot points on, plagioclase phenocrysts, including some trace element data, all obtained using Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), with Backscatter electron (BSE) images of crystals, obtained using Scanning Electron Microscope, reveal complex zoning profiles. However, chemical data for transects across pyroxene phenocrysts, obtained using EPMA, show this phenocryst phase is largely unzoned. The dataset also includes chemical data for spots on Fe\/Ti oxides, included on the rims of pyroxene, and obtained using EPMA. Matrix glass chemistry, obtained via EPMA, shows that the early eruptive ash is more evolved than the pyroclastic material that follows, and that there is a slight overall trend to a more homogenous, less evolved melt composition.\nThe 1883 eruption of Krakatau was a large, cardera-forming eruption that caused approximately 36,000 fatalities. It is also the only eruption of its size to have accompanying written accounts.",

        "description": "Linear features (shown as polylines) represent seven classes of geological structural features e.g. faults, folds or landforms e.g. buried channels, glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). The scale of the data is 1:10 000 scale. Onshore coverage is partial with approximately 30% of England, Scotland and Wales available in the version 2 data release. BGS intend to continue developing coverage at this scale; current focus is to include all large priority urban areas, along with road and rail transport corridors. Linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults. However landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits. The linear features are organised into seven main categories: Alteration area indicating zones of change to the pre-existing rocks due to the application of heat and pressure can occur round structural features such as faults and dykes. Fault where a body of bedrock has been fractured and displaced by a large scale process affecting the earth\u2019s crust. Fold where strata are bent or deformed resulting from changes or movement of the earth\u2019s surface creating heat and pressure to reshape and transform the original horizontal strata. Folds appear on all scales, in all rock types and from a variety of causes. Fossil horizons where prolific fossil assemblages occur and can be used to help establishing the order in which deposits were laid down (stratigraphy). These horizons allow correlation where sediments of the same age look completely different due to variations in depositional environment. Mineral vein where concentrations of crystallised mineral occur within a rock, they are closely associated with faulting but may occur independently. Landforms define the landscape by its surface form; these include glacial features such as drumlins, eskers and ice margins. Rock identifies key (marker) beds, recognised as showing distinct physical characteristics or fossil content. Examples include coal seams, gypsum beds and marine bands.

        "description": "Gravity, magnetic and radar data were acquired during a joint UK-Argentina (BAS\/IAA) project, during the austral summer 1998-1999. 10,771 line km of data were acquired using a BAS Twin Otter, covering an area of 21,000 km2 that comprises the James Ross Island archipelago and the NW corner of the Weddell Sea. Gravity and magnetic data were simultaneously acquired at a constant barometric height of 2000 m, providing a terrain clearance of approximately 100 m over the highest peaks. The main flight lines were flown along an E-W direction with 2000 m spacing over James Ross Island and at 4000 m interval offshore. Tie lines, oriented meridionally, were spaced 10,000 m and extended beyond the magnetic survey to provide a regional context to the survey area as required also for airborne gravity data analysis. Magnetic data were acquired at a frequency of 10 Hz using vapour cesium magnetometers mounted on the aircraft wing tips, and resampled to 1 Hz after compensation for manoeuvre noise. A triaxial fluxgate magnetometer was mounted close to the tail of the aircraft, providing magnetic attitude information used in the data compensation. However, gravity acquisition defines that turbulent conditions are avoided and so manoeuvre noise is generally minimal. Ashtech Z12 duel frequency GPS receivers were used for survey navigation and for post-processing of the GPS data. Magnetic data were de-spiked to remove avionics noise and then smoothed (- 300 m low pass filter), before re-sampling from 10 to 1 Hz. The data were first corrected for diurnal variations using low-pass filtered base station data (30 min low-pass filter). For the internal field we used the Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field Model 1995. The final data processing step was network levelling and microlevelling (Ferraccioli et al., 1998).

        "description": "A British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter and survey team acquired 8,300 line-km of magnetic data during the Austral summer of 1998\/99. Gravity and radio-echo data were acquired simultaneously with the magnetic data at a compromise constant barometric height of 2,200 m, which provides a terrain clearance of 100 m over the highest peaks. Two separate surveys were conducted; one at 5 km line spacing (tie lines at 20 km) over and stretching beyond the southern extent of the Forrestal range (main survey), and one at 2 km line spacing (tie lines at 8 km) covering the Dufek Massif (detailed survey). Wing-tip-mounted cesium vapour magnetometers acquired data at 10 Hz, which was resampled to 1 Hz after deletion of data corrupted by the radio echo transmissions. It is not possible to compensate the magnetic data for maneuver noise after this process as the data are under-;sampled with respect to maneuver noise. However, because gravity data was being acquired at the same time, turbulent conditions were avoided and so maneuver noise was at a minimum. Ashtech Z12 dual frequency GPS receivers were used for survey navigation. Pseudorange data were supplied to a Picodas PNAV navigation interface computer, which was used to guide the pilot along the pre-planned survey lines. The actual flight path was recovered, using carrier-phase, continuous, kinematic GPS processing techniques. All magnetic and pseudorange navigation data were recorded at 1 Hz on a Picodas PDAS 1000, PC-based data acquisition system. Data were de-spiked and then smoothed (~100 m low pass filter), before re-sampling from 10 to 1 Hz. The data were IGRF corrected, leveled and reduced to the pole in the field. A 2.5 km cell grid was produced. The negative bias to the anomaly amplitudes is a result of the poorly defined IGRF in this area.

        "description": "A high resolution survey was flown opportunistically by BAS at the end of the AGAP aerogeophysical campaign during the 2008-09 Antarctic field season with NSF support from McMurdo. The main purpose was to collect data on the ice shelf for a radar pre-site survey for a major planned international ANDRILL drilling campaign at Coulman High. Due to lack of appropriate funding levels from several countries this ANDRILL drilling project has been postponed (https:\/\/www.icdp-online.org\/projects\/world\/antarctica\/coulman-high\/) but the site remains nevertheless a potentially interesting target for future geoscience studies. The Coulman High project aimed to explore the range of paleo-environments, ecosystems and tectonic events that affected the Ross Sea region as it transitioned from the warm, high-CO2 Greenhouse world typical of the Eocene into the lower-CO2 and highly variable Icehouse conditions of the Oligocene and early Miocene. The aeromagnetic data released here can be used together with more extensive pre-existing international datasets to help study rift-related magmatism, faulting and sedimentary basins in the region.",

        "description": "This dataset contains visual and physical analyses of the impacts of ocean acidification on the skeletons of the cold-water coral <em>Lophelia pertusa<\/em>. Visual analysis includes synchrotron images from the Diamond Light Source and electron back scatter diffraction images on polished coral skeletons. Physical analyses include Raman spectroscopy data. Skeletal samples analysed were from the Southern California Bight (SCB), USA, and the Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC), UK. SCB samples were collected in 2010, 2014 and 2015. MRC samples were collected in 2012. Samples from the SCB cover an environmental gradient with respect to aragonite saturation, and corals from Mingulay were subjected to long-term experimentation in projected future conditions. SCB carbonate chemistry and sample metadata is included here, and conditions for MRC samples are outlined in Hennige et al. 2015. Ocean acidification is a threat to cold-water coral reefs in terms of dissolution to their skeletons, and their subsequent structural stability. This will likely determine the stability of the habitats they form.

        "description": "Adventdalen is a medium-sized (513 km^2) catchment in continuous permafrost zone of central Spitsbergen. It has 11.7 % glacier cover, a large flat valley floor comprised of uplifted, glaciomarine sediments, covered in the lower part by a veneer of aeolian sediments up to 4 m thick. The geology of the catchment is dominated by sandstones, shales and carbonates. There are a series of five open system pingos that have formed in the valley floor following uplift of the valley bottom over the last 10000 years. This has caused permafrost aggradation in former marine sediments which are up to 60 m thick. During the formation of this new permafrost, high pressure caused expulsion of groundwaters below, resulting in their upward migration. Freezing of the groundwaters as they reached the ground surface caused expansion and thus formation of the pingo. However, freezing no longer occurs at four of the five pingos, meaning that the groundwaters now discharge at the surface. Samples of the emerging groundwaters were collected every March\/April, but also opportunistically during summer months, provided the sites weren't flooded. Analysis of major ions (by ion chromatography), minor constituents (trace metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and silica by colorimetric analysis) and gases (O2, CO2 and CH4) were undertaken. Funding was provided by the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI-Climate Topic 2: Russian Arctic and Boreal Systems) Award No. 71126, distributed to Principal Investigator, Andrew Hodson (then of University of Sheffield) via NERC grant NE\/M019829\/1.",

        "description": "This dataset contains foraminifera abundance data and chronological information for samples taken from surface sediments and tidal marsh cores from sites at Chezzetcook (Nova Scotia), Sanborn Cove (Maine), and Barn Island (Connecticut). Relative sea-level (RSL) data has been determined by subtracting the elevation at which a fossil sample was originally deposited (calculated by a microfossil transfer function) from its present elevation (measured relative to national geodetic datums). Transfer functions were based on foraminiferal assemblages from previously collected data sets and, in one site (Connecticut), additional local foraminiferal data. The sampled depths cover age ranges of ~960 \u2013 2010 CE (Chezzetcook), ~1741 \u2013 2010 CE (Sanborn Cove), and ~1552 \u2013 2010 CE (Barn Island). Foraminifera data were quantified in core CZ-25 from Chezzetcook, core SN-3.3 from Sanborn Cove, and core BI-47.5 from Barn Island using light microscopy. For the foraminifera abundance data from samples taken from the surface sediments, at Chezzetcook marsh we used the local transfer function developed by Gehrels et al. (2005) from 46 foraminiferal samples collected by Scott and Medioli (Scott and Medioli, 1980). Scott and Medioli grouped Balticammina pseudomacrescens and Jadammina macrescens together as Trochammina macrescens. We also combined these foraminifera in our training set because it was not possible to retrospectively split these taxa. For the transfer function applied at Sanborn Cove we used the regional Maine dataset of Gehrels (2000). We removed all low marsh and tidal flat samples, leaving 44 samples containing the six primary agglutinated salt-marsh foraminiferal taxa. For the Connecticut transfer function we used the dataset of Edwards et al. (2004) and included 26 new samples we collected from Barn Island. The chronological data were derived using a variety of dating methods, including 14C, 210Pb, 137Cs, 206Pb\/207Pb, tephra, pollen markers and trace metal markers. The dataset includes 70 dated depths at Chezzetcook, 37 dated depths at Sanborn Cove, and 44 dated depths at Barn Island. The oldest uncalibrated radiocarbon age at Chezzetcook is 996 +\/- 36 14C years, with the surface dating to 2004 CE. At Sanborn Cove, the oldest date is 2064 +\/- 35 14C years, with the surface dating to 2010 CE. At Barn Island, the oldest date is 1020 +\/- 23 14C years, with the surface dating to 2010 CE. The radiocarbon dates include high precision dates obtained by pooling the mean of multiple age determinations on individual plant fragments at 2 sigma precision. This significantly reduces the error of the 14C ages for samples younger than ~300 calendar years (to between +\/-9 and +\/-17 14C yrs). Measurements of &apos;bomb-spike&apos; AMS14C in plant fragments are used to test model selection for 210Pb analyses. Age models are developed for cores using the Bayesian age-modelling software Bacon which takes into account the stratigraphical position of the sample, thereby reducing the number of possible solutions for the calibrated ages of the samples. The data were collected as part of an investigation into pre-industrial sea-level rise hotspots in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. The grant (NE\/G003440\/1): North Atlantic sea-level variability during the last half-millennium, aimed to quantify sea-level changes in the recent past in order to provide more accurate and precise predictions for the future.

Temperature was reconstructed using the Pearson et al. (2011) global calibration and the Foster et al. (2016) Antarctic calibration. For the latter, we studied 32 lakes from Antarctica, the sub-Antarctic Islands and Southern Chile to: 1) quantify their GDGT composition and investigate the environmental controls on GDGT composition; and 2) develop a GDGT-temperature calibration model for inferring past temperatures from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lakes. The downcore temperature reconstruction data produced using the new Antarctic brGDGT-temperature calibration were tested on Fan Lake and Yanou Lake to provide a proof of concept for the new calibration model in the Southern Hemisphere.

        "description": "Seismic refraction data were acquired at two sites on Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf, in November 2017. The acquisition was performed to measure seismic anisotropy, a proxy for the stress condition, in the ice shelf following the calving of Iceberg A68 in July 2017. 2D seismic profiles were acquired at two sites: S1, close to the new calving front of the ice shelf, and S2, advected downstream from the site surveyed in the NERC funded project NE\/E013414\/1 (SOLIS). Profiles were rotated about a common midpoint to examine the variation in seismic properties with azimuth. Throughout, 24 geophones were deployed at 10 m offset, with data recorded at a Geometrics GEODE system; data are presented here in SEG-2 format. All acquisitions were performed by Dr Jim White (British Geological Survey) and Emma Pearce (University of Leeds, School of Earth and Environment), with support from BAS.

        "description": "This collection comprises two time-series of 3D in-situ synchrotron x-ray microtomography (\u03bcCT) volumes showing two Ailsa Craig micro-granite samples (ACfresh02 and ACHT01) undergoing triaxial deformation. These data were collected in-situ at the PSICHE beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron, Gif-sur-Yvette, France in December 2016 (standard proposal 20160434) and are fully explained in Cartwright-Taylor A., Main, I.G., Butler, I.B., Fusseis, F., Flynn M. and King, A. (in press), Catastrophic failure: how and when? Insights from 4D in-situ x-ray micro-tomography, J. Geophys. Res. Solid Earth.\n\nTogether, these two time-series show the influence of heterogeneity on the micro-crack network evolution. Ailsa Craig micro-granite is known for being virtually crack-free. One sample (ACfresh02) remained as-received from the quarry until it was deformed, while the second (ACHT01) was slowly heated to 600 degC and then slowly cooled prior to deformation in order to introduce material disorder in the form of a network of nano-scale thermal cracks. Thus these two samples represent two extreme end-members: (i) ACfresh02 with the lowest possible (to our knowledge) natural pre-existing crack density, and so is a relatively homogeneous sample and (ii) ACHT01 with a thermally-induced nano-crack network imprinted over the nominally crack-free microstructure, and therefore has increased heterogeneity relative to ACfresh02. \n\nEach 3D \u03bcCT volume shows the sub-region of each sample in which the majority of damage was located and has three parts. Part one is reconstructed 16-bit greyscale data. Part two is 8-bit binary data showing individual voids (pores and micro-cracks) in the dataset after segmentation. Part three is 32-bit data showing the local thickness of each void, as in Cartwright-Taylor et al. (in press) Figures 4 and 5. Each part is a zip file containing a sequence of 2D image files (.tif), sequentially numbered according to the depth (in pixels, parallel to the loading axis) at which it lies within the sample volume. File dimensions are in pixels (2D), with an edge length of 2.7 microns. Each zip file is labelled with the sample name, the relevant letter for each 3D volume as given in Cartwright-Taylor et al. (in press) Tables 3 and 4, part 1, 2 or 3 (depending whether the data are greyscale, binary or local thickness respectively), the differential stress (MPa) on the sample, and the associated ram pressure (bar) to link with individual file names. The following convention is used:\n\nsample_letter_part_differentialstress_rampressure_datatype.\n\nAlso included are (i) two spreadsheets (.xlsx), one for each sample, containing processing parameters and the mechanical stress and strain at which each volume was scanned, and (ii) zip files containing .csv files containing measurement data for the labelled voids in each volume. N.B. void label numbers are not consistent between volumes so they can only be used to obtain global statistics, not to track individual voids.",

        "title": "The impact of mineral dissolution on drainage relative permeability and residual trapping in two carbonate rocks",
        "description": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into deep saline aquifers is governed by a number of physico-chemical processes including mineral dissolution and precipitation, multiphase fluid flow, and capillary trapping. These processes can be coupled, however, the impact of fluid-rock reaction on the multiphase flow properties is difficult to study and is not simply correlated to variation in rock porosity. We observed the impact of rock mineral dissolution on multiphase flow properties in two carbonate rocks with distinct pore structures. The Ketton carbonate was an ooidal limestone with a distinct bimodal pore structure whereas the Estaillades limestone was a bioclastic limestone with a wide range of pore sizes.  Observations of steady state N2-water relative permeability and residual trapping were obtained at 100 bars fluid pressure and 22oC, with X-ray tomography used to estimate fluid saturation. These tests alternated with steps in which mineral was uniformly dissolved into solution from the rock cores using an aqueous solution with a temperature controlled acid. Eight alternating sequences of dissolution and flow measurement were performed, with on average 0.5% of the mass of the rocks dissolved at each stage. A sequence of mercury injection capillary pressure measurements were conducted on a parallel set of samples undergoing the same treatment to characterize the evolving pore size distribution and corresponding capillary pressure characteristics.  Variations in the multiphase flow properties were observed to correspond to the changes in the underlying pore structure. In the Ketton carbonate, dissolution resulted in an increase of the fraction of pore volume made up by the smallest pores and a corresponding increase in the fraction made up by the largest pores. This resulted in a systematic increase in the relative permeability to the nonwetting phase and decrease in relative permeability of the wetting phase. There was also a modest but systematic decrease in residual trapping. In the Estaillades carbonate, dissolution resulted in an increase in the fraction of pore volume made up by pores in the central range of the initial pore size distribution, and a corresponding decrease in the fraction made up by both the smallest and largest pores. This resulted in a decrease in the relative permeability to both the wetting and nonwetting fluid phases and no discernible impact on the residual trapping.  In summary, the impact of rock matrix dissolution will be strongly dependent on the impact of that dissolution on the underlying pore structure of the rock. However, if the variation in pore structure can be observed or estimated with modelling, then it should be possible to estimate the impacts on multiphase flow properties.",
