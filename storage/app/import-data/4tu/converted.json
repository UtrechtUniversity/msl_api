        "description": "This dataset contains the data corresponding to the following publication:Linda Ritzen, Vincenzo Montano and Santiago J. Garcia. 3D Printing of aSelf-Healing Thermo-plastic Polyurethane Through FDM: from Polymer Slab to Mechanical Assessment. Polymers 2021, 13, 305.https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/polym13020305<br>Abstract:The use of self-healing (SH) polymers to make 3D-printed polymeric parts offers the potential to increase the quality of 3D-printed parts and to increase their durability and damage tolerance due to their (on-demand) dynamic nature. Nevertheless, 3D-printing of such dynamic polymers is not a straightforward process due to their polymer architecture and rheological complexity and the limited quantities produced at lab-scale. This limits the exploration of the full potential of self-healing polymers. In this paper, we present the complete process for fused deposition modelling of a room temperature self-healing polyurethane. Starting from the synthesis and polymer slab manufacturing, we processed the polymer into a continuous filament and 3D printed parts. For the characterization of the 3D printed parts, we used a compression cut test, which proved useful when limited amount of material is available. The test was able to quasi-quantitatively assess both bulk and 3D printed samples and their self-healing behavior. The mechanical and healing behavior of the 3D printed self-healing polyurethane was highly similar to that of the bulk SH polymer. This indicates that the self-healing property of the polymer was retained even after multiple processing steps and printing. Compared to a commercial 3D-printing thermoplastic polyurethane, the self-healing polymer displayed a smaller mechanical dependency on the printing conditions with the added value of healing cuts at room temperature.<br>The dataset contains the following measurements:- Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of SH-TPU.- Filament thickness measurements of the filaments used for 3D printing.- Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of SH-TPU in the pristine, filament and 3D printed condition.- Force-displacement curves of the mechanical testing of SH-TPU and commercial TPU Ninjaflex.- Rheology results (shear rate analysis and temperature sweep) of SH-TPU and commercial TPU Ninjaflex.- Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of SH-TPU in pristine and filament condition.<br>The experimental set-up used to obtain these data can be found in the article and has also been included in the .txt files in the folders of the measurements. <br>",

        "description": "Repeated earthquake cycles produce topography, fault damage zones, and other geologic structures along faults. These geomorphic and structural features indicate the presence of co-seismic permanent (inelastic) surface deformation, yet a long-standing question in earthquake research is how much of the co-seismic deformation field is elastic versus inelastic. These questions arise in part because it is unclear what measurable co-seismic characteristics, such as off-fault or distributed surface deformation and cracking, represent true unrecoverable deformation. One emerging descriptor of permanent co-seismic deformation is surface strain magnitudes inferred from imaging geodesy observations. In this study, we present the surface strain field of the 2013 Mw7.7 Baluchistan strike-slip earthquake in southern Pakistan. We invert co-seismic displacement fields generated from pixel-tracking of SPOT-5 and WorldView optical imagery for co-seismic surface horizontal strain tensors. We observe that co-seismic strain field is dominated by negative dilatation strains, indicating that the co-seismic fault zone contracted during the earthquake. We show that co-seismic inelastic failure exhibits a relatively consistent width along the rupture that is localized to a zone 100-200 m wide on the hanging wall side. The width of co-seismic permanent deformation does not correlate with variations in off-fault deformation or surface geology. Based on comparisons to other recent earthquakes, we posit that the permanent surface strains reflect inelastic deformation of the faults inner damage zone, and that the width of this zone reflects fault maturity.",

This finite fault model was used in the study of post-seismic surface displacements following the 2018 <i>M<sub>w<\/sub><\/i> 7.5 Palu earthquake (in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems entitled: A transient in surface motions dominated by deep afterslip subsequent to a shallow supershear earthquake: the 2018 <i>M<sub>w<\/sub><\/i> 7.5 Palu case).<br>This finite fault model was determined as an intermediate result in another study, on the co-seismic surface displacement and tsunami generation by Simons and Broerse et al. which is currently (Februari 2021) in preparation entitled: \u201cA tsunami generated by a strike-slip event: constraints from space geodesy on the 2018 Palu earthquake\u201d. This study combines co-seismic GPS offsets with a multitude of SAR-derived displacement fields in a Bayesian approach to infer the most likely fault slip distribution on a set of fault segments in NW Sulawesi. The surface fault trace dictates the succession of linear fault segments with distinct dip angles that loosely connect to a long segment at depth. This fits well within the tectonic setting of the Palu Valley and Bay area which is characterized as a transtensional basin. In this finite fault model it is assumed that the surface fault trace is continuous in Palu Bay so that those segments north and south of Palu Bay continue offshore with their respective azimuths and connect.",

        "description": "Identification of the catalyst characteristics correlating with the key performance parameters including selectivity and stability is key to the rational catalyst design. Herein we focused on the identification of property-performance relationships in the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process by studying in detail the catalytic behaviour of MFI, MEL and their respective intergrowth zeolites. The detailed material characterization reveals that both the high production of propylene and butylenes and the large MeOH conversion capacity correlate with the enrichment of lattice Al sites in the channels of the pentasil structure as identified by 27Al MAS NMR and 3-methylpentane cracking results. The lack of correlation between MTO performance and other catalyst characteristics, such as crystal size, presence of external Br\u00f8nsted acid sites (BAS) and Al pairing suggests their less pronounced role in defining the propylene selectivity. Our analysis reveals that catalyst deactivation is rather complex and is strongly affected by the enrichment of lattice Al in the intersections, the overall Al-content, and crystal size. The intergrowth of MFI and MEL phases accelerates the catalyst deactivation rate.",

We conduct laboratory experiments to simulate the pulse-like (i.e. short but rapid) fault slip behavior characteristic for small magnitude human-induced seismicity, using a newly designed experimental set-up enabling monitoring of the slip behavior under stress and displacement closer to conditions relevant to faults in Groningen. The enclosed dataset, \"Data submitted to 4TU.Researchdata\" is the compressed file ('.rar'), which consists of 1) a table listing the information of all the experiments, 2) 82 data files ('.txt') of the smoothed data (~every 66 datapoints) for all the experiments.

        "description": "Parts produced with metal additive manufacturing often suffer from a poor surface finish. Surface finishing techniques are effective to improve the quality of 3D printed surfaces, however they have as downsides that they also slightly change the geometry of the part, in an unpredictable way. This effect on the geometrical features of complex parts has received little attention. In this research, we illustrate a method to visualize the impact of surface finishing techniques on geometrical features, as well as their effectiveness on parts with high shape-complexity, by using centrifugal disk finishing as a case study. We designed and 3D printed test parts with different features using selective laser melting, which were coated with a blue metal lacquer prior to polishing. After polishing, the blue lacquer was eroded away from the spots that were easily reached by the polishing process, yet had remained on the surfaces that could not be reached by the process. We used measurements of material removal and image processing of the remaining blue lacquer on the surfaces to analyze these effects. Using this method, we were able to derive a number of specific design guidelines that can be incorporated while designing metal AM parts for centrifugal disk finishing. We suggest that this visualization method can be applied to different polishing methods to gain insight into their influence, as well as being used as an aid in the design process.",

        "description": "In landfill foundation treatment, high-level radioactive waste disposal, geothermal resources development and utilization and other engineering construction practice, there is a large amount of unsaturated soil. When unsaturated soil is affected by sunlight, geothermal, nuclear waste, biochemical reaction and other thermal radiation, it will accelerate the settlement and deformation of soil temperature. The building structure based on unsaturated soil will also be affected, so it is of great significance to study the influence of temperature on the stress and deformation of unsaturated soil. In this paper, by extending the SFG model of unified yield surface to consider the influence of temperature change on unified yield surface, a yield surface constitutive model which can reflect temperature-suction-stress at the same time is proposed.In order to verify the applicability of the model, triaxial tests on Jiangxi laterite at different temperatures are carried out to determine the parameters needed for model calculation. The model fitting results are obtained by using the test parameters and compared with the test results. With reference to the experimental data of remolded clay used in the literature by Uchaipichat et al, the model was fitted and analyzed. The results show that the unified yield surface SFG model considering the effect of temperature can better reflect the stress-strain characteristics of soil during compression rebound, dehumidification and shear, and verify the reliability of the constitutive model to reflect the stress-strain characteristics of soil at different temperatures, thus further enriching the constitutive theory of unsaturated soil under the influence of temperature.",

        "description": "<em>Reserach data used in the following publication:<\/em><strong>Tires for Mars Rovers: Reinforcing BR and BR\/Vinyl-Methyl Silicone Rubber Compounds with Carbon Black, Nano-CaCO3, or Silica for Good Low-Temperature Dynamic-Mechanical Performance<\/strong><em>Abstract:<\/em>Dynamic increment in Mars exploration missions necessitates the development of new materials that can satisfy the ever more stringent requirements. Currently, most of the materials used for manufacturing Mars rovers and landers are based on various metal alloys that provide high reliability in the Martian environment. However, the future planned missions, including the first human crew landing on Mars, require the development of new rubber materials that could be used for sealing Mars suits, for tires\/tracks, and for damping systems for heavy Mars rovers. This research aims to investigate the properties of butadiene rubber (BR) and butadiene\/vinyl-methyl silicone rubber blends (BR\/VMQ) filled with various reinforcing fillers: carbon blacks (CBs), silicas, and nanometric calcium carbonate (nano-CaCO<sub>3<\/sub>), in order to evaluate their performance from the point of view of Mars' environmental applications. The study revealed that the designed composites exhibit very good low-temperature elasticity, and the addition of 30 phr of high surface area CB (N220) or silica (Ultrasil 9100) results in good mechanical properties of the compounds. The mechanical properties of the BR\/VMQ blends depend on the type of reinforcing filler. The addition of the CBs resulted in better mechanical properties, while the incorporation of silicas worsens the mechanical properties of BR\/VMQ blends in comparison to their BR counterparts. The high-cis BR grade exhibits a strong tendency to crystallize in the operating temperature range on Mars (crystallization \u223c\u221260 \u00b0C, melting \u223c\u221220 \u00b0C), and the addition of the fillers nucleates the crystallization, resulting in a higher amount of the crystalline phase. This might be a serious problem for any sealing application of the rubber compounds. For this reason, a non-crystallizable BR grade is recommended for further studies.",

The tool consists of an undiagnostic flint flake embedded in a thick piece of birch tar dating from the Middle Palaeolithic. It is a significant find because 1) it is the first to be discovered in the Netherlands and the 5th in Europe and 2) both the composite nature of the tool and the presence of tar which resulted from a complex transformative technology illustrates the Neandertal intellectual capacities. This is the first ever tar backed tool which has been securely dated, chemically analysed, subjected to optical microscopy wear analysis, and scanned with a X-ray micro-CT scanner. All analyses are presented and discussed in a multidisciplinary article written by Niekus et al.. The article has been submitted for review shortly after the scan data has been published in the 4TU Centre for Research Data. The micro-CT scan data which reveals the inner structure of the tar, the flint and the morphology of the flint-tar interface is presented as supplementary material to the article. The data set is made of 5 types of files: - Images of the digitally reconstructed tool in dcm format (dicom files). The images can be used to visualize the tool in 3D with public domain open source software ImageJ. They can also be further post-processed. Upon request the raw scan data (before re-construction) can be provided. - The surface meshes of the flint and the tar in obj and ud3 formats. The surfaces can be inspected separately in 3D using public domain open source software Meshlab. They can also be 3D printed. - A video in wmv format allowing to explore the inner and outer structure of the tool. - A pdf describing features displayed in the video. - A pdf containing the meta-data related to the scan and the data processing.",

        "description": "Elastocoast is a special elastomeric polyurethane system made by Elastogran. It binds broken rocks or stones together to form a stable material which is not only solid but also elastic so that it is able to be an ideal material for hydraulic applications. As a new developed material for revetment, the performance of Elastocoast in the application of revetments is still unknown. This research is carried out to study the feasibility of the Elasatocoast's applications as revetments. Due to the similarities between Elastocoast and open stone asphalt, most of the experiments are done according to the concerning problems of the open stone asphalt revetments. Five properties were tested: porosity, permeability between the material and geotextile, wave run-up, stability on slope and resistance to erosion. It turned out that compared to open stone asphalt Elastocoast is a strong and permeable material and it is relatively easy to construct and maintain. It is expected to be a suitable material as revetment.",

        "description": "We synthesize graphene by ball milling of synthetic graphite (graphite with 99.9% purity (Mesh # 100)) and solid CO2 (dry ice) as a precursor for 24 hours. The materials obtained were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental chemical analysis by energy dispersion x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). In addition, it was determined that the compounds obtained possess between 6 and 14 graphene sheets, depending on the grinding time. These determinations were determined by means of XRD, and the results were corroborated with Raman spectroscopy. The composition of the materials obtained is 92% carbon and approximately 8% oxygen through EDS and XPS measurements. From X-ray diffraction using Mo (K\u03b1), structural analysis for non-crystalline systems by means of the radial distribution function RDF(r) and total distribution function T(r) was realized to determine the coordination numbers as well as atomic distances within short-range order (SRO) in the obtained material, with a structural disorder parameter (\u03be) of approximately 3.5. Then, the graphene base structure was modelled for the 24-hour sample. The TEM results confirm that different deformed graphene constituent planes in the observed graphene nanoplatelet (GnP) arrangement were obtained, which were caused by the tensions imposed during the material synthesis process in significant quantities by ball milling.",

        "title": "Acoustic, mechanical, and microstructure data used in: Coda-Wave Based Monitoring of Pore-Pressure Depletion-driven Compaction of Slochteren Sandstone Samples from the Groningen Gas Field",
        "description": "Pore-pressure depletion in sandstone reservoirs is well known to cause both elastic and inelastic compaction, often resulting in notable surface subsidence and induced seismicity. Recent studies indicate that in such cases inelastic strain, which is often neglected in geomechanical models, represents a significant proportion of the total strain throughout reservoir production. While there has been considerable effort to quantify the proportion of continuous inelastic deformation from the mechanical response of laboratory samples, there has been little focus to date on the associated acoustic response throughout compaction. With this in mind, we employ three coda-wave based processing methods for the active source monitoring of ultrasonic velocity, scattering power, and intrinsic\/scattering attenuation during the pore-pressure depletion of core samples from the Slochteren sandstone reservoir in the Groningen gas field (the Netherlands). Our results corroborate previous studies suggesting that initially, inelastic deformation occurs primarily along intergranular boundaries, with intergranular cracking developing towards the end of depletion and particularly for the highest porosity samples. Furthermore, analysis of Biot type intrinsic attenuation indicates that this compaction occurs in several stages of predominately intergranular closure, transitioning into primarily intergranular slip\/cracking, and eventually porosity-dependent intragranular cracking. We demonstrate how this segmentation of pore-pressure driven compaction can be used to characterise differences in sample properties, and monitor the evolution of microstructural inelastic deformation throughout depletion. We further discuss the feasibility of in\/cross-borehole monitoring of reservoir compaction, for both improved geo-mechanical modelling and early warning detection of induced seismicity.",

This is a typical study of applied geochemistry. The data consists of chemical compositions of 67 elements, 11 oxides, H2O+, total carbon and organic carbon in surface sediments (collected at a depth of ~25cm) from Junggar Basin, Tarim Basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau, Qaidam Basin, South Alxa Plateau, North Alxa Plateau, Hetao Graben and northeastern sandy deserts, and in the last glacial loess and present interglacial sediments on the Chinese Loess Plateau. All the samples were collected at a continental-scale (1 site per 3000 km2). All the sites were designed far away from roads, farmland and residences to avoid any possible anthropogenic influence. After being air-dried and homogenized, each sample was sieved to less than 75 \u03bcm using a stainless steel screen.

We conducted a field survey in the Dutch Wadden Sea (10 sampling sites) to determine the prevalence of the disease in Baltic tellins in the Wadden Sea and to quantify its severity via histology. Briefly, bivalves were sampled by brushing away the first 10 cm of the sediment surface. Organisms were then collected by hand and keep in the Davidson\u2019s fixative on back in the lab. Tissues of samples were then collected and embedded in paraffin blocks. Histological sections of 5 \u00b5m thickness were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and the slides examined for the presence of disseminated neoplasia using light microscopy. If neoplastic cells were present, we determined the disease severity according to Christensen et al. (1974) and Pekkarinen (1993) as follows: stage 1, local neoplastic cells noticed in the gills; stage 2, gills totally invaded with neoplastic cells; stage 3, spots of neoplastic cells in other tissues than gills, and stage 4, widespread neoplastic cells. For each sampling site, we calculated the prevalence of the disease and the prevalence of each stage of the disease. The data set is an excel file, with different columns, specifying where and when bivalves were sampled, the type of environment (sandy mud, muddy sand or sand), the density of the bivalve at each location, and the stage of the disease (O to 4).",

        "description": "Foraminiferal trace element concentrations were determined using two laser ablation ICP-MS systems. Prior to laser ablation, all samples were gently cleaned in methanol (x1) and UHQ water (x4). Between each rinse, the samples were placed in a sonic bath for several seconds to thoroughly clean the tests. Benthic foraminifera from 745m (station D), 980m (station C), 1488m (station B), and 1987m (station A) were measured at Utrecht University using a deep UV (193 nm) ArF excimer laser (Lambda Physik) with GeoLas 200Q optics. Ablation was performed at a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz and an energy density of 1.4 J\/cm\u00b2, with a crater size of 80 \u03bcm. Ablated particles were measured by a quadrupole ICP-MS (Micromass Platform) equipped with a collision and reaction cell. Such a collision and reaction cell improves carbonate analyses by eliminating interferences on mass 44. Scanned masses included 24Mg, 26Mg, 27Al, 42Ca, 43Ca, 55Mn, 88Sr, 137Ba, 138Ba, and 208Pb. Benthic foraminifera from stations F (350 m) and E (552 m) were analyzed at ETH Zurich (due to laboratory renovations at Utrecht University). The laser type and ablation parameters were identical to those detailed above. The ablated particles were measured using a quadrupole ICP-MS (ELAN 6100 DRC, PerkinElmer). In both cases, calibration was performed using an international standard (NIST610) with Ca as an internal standard (Jochum et al., 2011). The same masses as measured in Utrecht were monitored, in addition to 7Li, 23Na, 47Ti, 60Ni, 61Ni, and 89Y. Interlaboratory compatibility was monitored using a matrix-matched calcite standard. For Mn, reported here, this standard showed a precision better than 3%over all analyses, at ETH and UU, and with an offset of less than 5%from an offline-determined (solution ICP-AES) concentration analyzing discrete subsamples. The matrix-matched standard is routinely included in the analyses and has been monitored since 2010 at Utrecht University. Analytical error (equivalent to 1 sigma), based on repeated measurement of an external standard, was &lt; 5% for reported elements. Each laser ablation measurement was screened for contamination by monitoring Al and Pb. On encountering surface contamination, the data integration interval was adjusted to exclude any Al or Pb enrichment. Cross-plots between Al and Pb versus Mn showed that they are unrelated, confirming the accuracy of the integrations.",

        "title": "Erosion tests with the annular flume",
        "description": "To predict the changes of natural systems like estuaries and tidal lagoons as a consequence of human interferences often numerical models are applied. An important aspect is the erosion and transport of sediment. Therefore, these models require formulations that describe the erosion of the sediment bed consisting of sand, mud and organic matter. A physically founded and validated process-based description of these mixed sediments is still missing. Recently, a theoretically derived formulation for erosion of mixed sediments has been proposed. However, a proper validation of this new formula is lacking. Therefore, a systematic study has been undertaken. First, studies have been executed to investigate the individually physical properties in this formula. Next, erosion tests have been executed on a large number of varying sample compositions using a straight, re-circulating flume. The effect of sediment structures and cohesiveness of the sediment bed has been investigated, from which the new formulations could be qualified. However, this experimental set-up was relatively small, with possible large influences of e.g. boundary effects. Therefore, another set of erosion experiments had to be carried out to supplement the results of the mentioned tests. The objective of this study was to quantify the newly defined theorem for the erosion behavior of sand-mud mixtures. The experiments were carried out on three different artificially generated sand-silt-clay mixtures, using a large annular flume. The mixtures were homogeneously mixed and 100% saturated and, subsequently, placed in the flume. A unidirectional flow was generated by rotating the top-lid and the flume in opposite directions. The flow-induced shear stresses near the bottom were varied by increasing the rotational speeds step by step. An observation on the erosion behavior of the beds was carried out, as well as the measurement of the concentration of suspended fines over the vertical. Due to the occurring secondary currents, the eroded sand accumulated along the outer bend of the flume. By collecting this the amount of eroded sand was quantified. The shear stresses near the bottom were not measured directly, but were determined by means of a large eddy simulation model. The results show two parts regarding the erosion behavior of the mixtures. Before the complete failure of the bed (part 2), different modes of erosion were identified in which only small amounts of material were eroded (part 1). Mainly due to the placement of the bed, the bed strength was slightly varying in the upper part of the sediment bed concerning both the horizontal as the vertical direction. In this first part floc erosion occurred for the fines. Sand was transported as bed load as well as in the sheet flow regime. For this part, the concentration of eroded fines showed a typically non-linear increase as usually occurred for erosion tests with deposited beds. Several possible explanations for this unexpected behavior are discussed. For part 2, surface erosion was observed, during which the concentration was increasing linearly with time. The erosion rate as function of bed shear stresses revealed that the threshold of erosion for samples with a sand-silt skeleton was relatively high, while the threshold for the sample with the clay-water matrix was lower. A transition in erosion behavior was observed when regarding the erosion parameters for both fines and sand. This transition occurred for a plasticity index of around seven, which agrees well with the transition in mechanical behavior for sand-dominated to clay-dominated sediment as found in previous empirical geotechnical studies.",

        "description": "Using active ultrasonic source survey data, Coda-wave Decorrelation (CWD) time-lapse imaging during the triaxial compression of Whitby Mudstone cores provides a 3-D description of the evolution and redistribution of inelastic strain concentrations. Acoustic Emissions (AEs) monitoring is also performed between any two consecutive surveys. From these data, we investigate the impact of initial water saturation $S_w$ on the onset, growth, and reactivation of inelastic deformation, compared to the post-deformation fracture network extracted from X-ray tomography scans. Our results indicate for the applied strain-rate and degree of initial water saturation, and within the frequency range of our ultrasonic transducers (0.1 to 1 MHz), that inelastic strain localisation and propagation in the Whitby Mudstone does not radiate AEs of sufficient magnitude to be detected above the average noise level. This is true for both the initial onset of inelasticity (strain localisation), and during macroscopic failure. In contrast, the CWD results indicate the onset of what is interpreted as localised regions of inelastic strain at less than fifty percent of the peak differential stress the Whitby Mudstone can sustain. The seemingly aseismic nature of these clay-rich rocks suggests the gradual development of inelastic strain, from the microscopic diffuse damage, up until the macroscopic shear failure.",

        "description": "In order to investigate the effect of semi-arid climate on clogging of the permeable pavements, porous concrete was chosen in this research as the proper type to apply in these areas. As the fine dust in these areas is the main cause of clogging, the pavement behavior under this condition was evaluated by the lab experiment. During the lab experiment different sub-bases (sand and stone) were also examined to see the differences in clogging process under various conditions. The results from this research shows that the wind suspended particles, as the main cause of clogging in semi-arid areas, can be washed through the pavement and cause a very slow clogging process. Comparison the results of different sub-bases shows the significant effect of the pores size in the sub-base on the clogging process. In case of higher porous sub-base, sediments can be migrated from the pavement to the sub-base easily. But in case of less porous sub-base the blocking of the interface and first layers of the sub-base can create more resistance through the flow migration. As the clogging in case of larger particles happens rapidly, therefore in order to design the pavement, average size of particles that can go through it should be taken into account.",
