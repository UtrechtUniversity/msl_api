        "title": "GeoDFN - A Flexible, Open-Source Software for Generating Geologically Consistent Discrete Fracture Networks",
        "description": "GeoDFN is an open-source software that provides comprehensive control over fracture properties and allows us to explore how a broad range of geological uncertainties impact the geometry and connectivity of fracture networks. GeoDFN employs a hybrid approach, combining the advantages of mechanical and statistical methods in generating DFNs, which ensures geological consistency in fracture placement while maintaining computational efficiency. At the core of this hybrid approach is the consideration of stress shadow, as buffer zone around fractures, which impose a minimum spacing between fractures and prevent them from being placed in geologically unrealistic locations. Considering stress shadow also imposes a natural limit on the maximum fracture intensity of the network, reflecting the network saturation observed in real geological formations. Various models for calculating fracture apertures are provided in GeoDFN, including models that account for external stress conditions, such as the Barton-Bandis model. This capability enables detailed analysis of how fracture apertures influence fluid flow and network permeability under different geological conditions.<br>GeoDFN can be linked to any flow simulator capable of modeling fluid flow in fractured geological formations, providing a versatile tool for subsurface flow analysis. Here, we demonstrate its integration with the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST), an open-source simulator widely used for modeling flow and transport processes. The integration with MRST enables users to easily import generated DFNs and conduct a variety of simulations, including single-phase and multiphase flow, heat transfer, and solute transport. By utilizing MRST\u2019s Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) approach, the complex interactions between fractures and the surrounding rock matrix are accurately represented. This connection facilitates the evaluation of how different uncertainties in fracture properties affect subsurface flow behavior, making it a powerful tool for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in diverse geological settings.<br>",

        "description": "Tidal flats provide valuable ecosystem services such as flood protection and carbon sequestration. Erosion and accretion processes govern the eco-geomorphic evolution of intertidal ecosystems (marshes and bare flats), and hence substantially affect their valuable ecosystem services. To understand the intertidal ecosystem development, high-frequency bed-level change data are thus needed. However, such datasets are scarce due to the lack of suitable methods that do not involve excessive labour and\/or instrument cost. By applying newly-developed Surface Elevation Dynamics sensors (SED-sensors), we obtained unique high-resolution daily bed-level change data sets in the period 2013-2017 from 10 saltmarsh sites situated in the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain in contrasting physical and biological settings. At each site, multiple sensors were deployed for 9-20 months to ensure sufficient spatial and temporal coverage of highly variable bed level change processes. The bed level change data are provided with synchronized hydrodynamic data, i.e. water level, wave height, tidal current velocity, and medium grain size (D50) as well as (for some sites) chlorophyll-a level and organic matter content of the surface sediment. This dataset has revealed diverse spatial morphodynamic patterns over daily to seasonal scales, which are valuable to theoretical and model development. On the daily scale, this dataset is particularly instructive as it includes a number of storm events, the response to which can be detected in the bed level change observations. Such data are rare but useful to study tidal flat response to highly energetic conditions.",

Due to its slightly-destructive sampling nature and its good agreement with triplet results, the core testing method is confirmed to be a competitive technique for the in-situ assessment of the cohesion, friction coefficient, and shear modulus of mortar.

        "description": "Hydrophilic organic micropollutants are commonly detected in source water used for drinking water production. Effective technologies to remove these micropollutants from water include adsorption onto granular activated carbon in fixed-bed filters. The rate-determining step in adsorption using activated carbon is usually the adsorbate diffusion inside the porous adsorbent. The presence of mesopores can facilitate diffusion, resulting in higher adsorption rates.We used two different types of granular activated carbon, with and without mesopores, to study the adsorption rate of hydrophilic micropollutants. Furthermore, equilibrium studies were performed to determine the affinity of the selected micropollutants for the activated carbons. A pore diffusion model was applied to the kinetic data to obtain pore diffusion coefficients. We observed that the adsorption rate is influenced by the molecular size of the micropollutant as well as the granular activated carbon pore size.",

        "title": "Data underlying the publication: Multi-material adhesive joints with thick bond-lines: crack onset and crack deflection",
        "description": "Structural bonding of composite materials is being used in shipbuilding and civil industries. Due to manufacturing and in-service constraints, the bonded regions are characterized by adhesive layers with a thickness of up to 10 mm. With such thicknesses, a weakness to be recognized, from both scientific and applied points of view, is the stress gradient at bi-material edges and corners, exacerbated by differences in materials properties. This study aims to investigate the fracture onset and crack deflection in adhesive joints with thick bond-lines (\u2248 10 mm) under global mode I loading. More specifically, the role of adherend-adhesive modulus-mismatch and the role of pre-crack length, \u0394\ud835\udc4e, are scrutinized. The parameters controlling the crack path directional stability are also discussed. Single-material (i.e. steel-steel and GFRP-GFRP) and bi-material (i.e. steel-GFRP) double-cantilever beam joints bonded with a structural epoxy adhesive are tested. The tests are aided by a 3D image acquisition system. Moreover, the different joints are modelled analytically, considering a beam on elastic-plastic foundation, to indicate and include characteristic length scales of the problem (e.g. adhesive thickness, yield plastic zone, elastic zone). To link the experimental findings to existing theoretical models, the behaviour of the different joints is also assessed numerically. An empirical relation, in terms of geometrical and material properties of the joints, that defines the transition between non-cohesive and cohesive fracture onset is found - for a given material mismatch (\u0394\ud835\udc4ecrit.\/\u210eadher)4 \u223c (\ud835\udc61a\/\u210eadher). In general, for \u0394\ud835\udc4e &lt; \u0394\ud835\udc4ecrit.: the stress singularity near the bi-material corner rules over the stress singularity at the pre-crack tip. The bi-material corner with the highest modulus-mismatch dictates the region of fracture initiation; for \u0394\ud835\udc4e \u2a7e \u0394\ud835\udc4ecrit.: the stress singularity at the pre-crack tip is dominant, resulting in cohesive fracture onset. However, the cracking direction rapidly deflects out from the adhesive layer centre-line. Positive \ud835\udc47-stress along the crack tip is found considering 10 mm thick bond-line, being one of the factors for unstable crack path.",

        "description": "This dataset contains the data corresponding to the following publication:Linda Ritzen, Vincenzo Montano and Santiago J. Garcia. 3D Printing of aSelf-Healing Thermo-plastic Polyurethane Through FDM: from Polymer Slab to Mechanical Assessment. Polymers 2021, 13, 305.https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/polym13020305<br>Abstract:The use of self-healing (SH) polymers to make 3D-printed polymeric parts offers the potential to increase the quality of 3D-printed parts and to increase their durability and damage tolerance due to their (on-demand) dynamic nature. Nevertheless, 3D-printing of such dynamic polymers is not a straightforward process due to their polymer architecture and rheological complexity and the limited quantities produced at lab-scale. This limits the exploration of the full potential of self-healing polymers. In this paper, we present the complete process for fused deposition modelling of a room temperature self-healing polyurethane. Starting from the synthesis and polymer slab manufacturing, we processed the polymer into a continuous filament and 3D printed parts. For the characterization of the 3D printed parts, we used a compression cut test, which proved useful when limited amount of material is available. The test was able to quasi-quantitatively assess both bulk and 3D printed samples and their self-healing behavior. The mechanical and healing behavior of the 3D printed self-healing polyurethane was highly similar to that of the bulk SH polymer. This indicates that the self-healing property of the polymer was retained even after multiple processing steps and printing. Compared to a commercial 3D-printing thermoplastic polyurethane, the self-healing polymer displayed a smaller mechanical dependency on the printing conditions with the added value of healing cuts at room temperature.<br>The dataset contains the following measurements:- Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of SH-TPU.- Filament thickness measurements of the filaments used for 3D printing.- Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of SH-TPU in the pristine, filament and 3D printed condition.- Force-displacement curves of the mechanical testing of SH-TPU and commercial TPU Ninjaflex.- Rheology results (shear rate analysis and temperature sweep) of SH-TPU and commercial TPU Ninjaflex.- Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of SH-TPU in pristine and filament condition.<br>The experimental set-up used to obtain these data can be found in the article and has also been included in the .txt files in the folders of the measurements. <br>",

        "description": "Repeated earthquake cycles produce topography, fault damage zones, and other geologic structures along faults. These geomorphic and structural features indicate the presence of co-seismic permanent (inelastic) surface deformation, yet a long-standing question in earthquake research is how much of the co-seismic deformation field is elastic versus inelastic. These questions arise in part because it is unclear what measurable co-seismic characteristics, such as off-fault or distributed surface deformation and cracking, represent true unrecoverable deformation. One emerging descriptor of permanent co-seismic deformation is surface strain magnitudes inferred from imaging geodesy observations. In this study, we present the surface strain field of the 2013 Mw7.7 Baluchistan strike-slip earthquake in southern Pakistan. We invert co-seismic displacement fields generated from pixel-tracking of SPOT-5 and WorldView optical imagery for co-seismic surface horizontal strain tensors. We observe that co-seismic strain field is dominated by negative dilatation strains, indicating that the co-seismic fault zone contracted during the earthquake. We show that co-seismic inelastic failure exhibits a relatively consistent width along the rupture that is localized to a zone 100-200 m wide on the hanging wall side. The width of co-seismic permanent deformation does not correlate with variations in off-fault deformation or surface geology. Based on comparisons to other recent earthquakes, we posit that the permanent surface strains reflect inelastic deformation of the faults inner damage zone, and that the width of this zone reflects fault maturity.",

This study combines co-seismic GPS offsets with a multitude of SAR-derived displacement fields in a Bayesian approach to infer the most likely fault slip distribution on a set of fault segments in NW Sulawesi. The surface fault trace dictates the succession of linear fault segments with distinct dip angles that loosely connect to a long segment at depth. This fits well within the tectonic setting of the Palu Valley and Bay area which is characterized as a transtensional basin. In this finite fault model it is assumed that the surface fault trace is continuous in Palu Bay so that those segments north and south of Palu Bay continue offshore with their respective azimuths and connect.",

        "description": "Identification of the catalyst characteristics correlating with the key performance parameters including selectivity and stability is key to the rational catalyst design. Herein we focused on the identification of property-performance relationships in the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process by studying in detail the catalytic behaviour of MFI, MEL and their respective intergrowth zeolites. The detailed material characterization reveals that both the high production of propylene and butylenes and the large MeOH conversion capacity correlate with the enrichment of lattice Al sites in the channels of the pentasil structure as identified by 27Al MAS NMR and 3-methylpentane cracking results. The lack of correlation between MTO performance and other catalyst characteristics, such as crystal size, presence of external Br\u00f8nsted acid sites (BAS) and Al pairing suggests their less pronounced role in defining the propylene selectivity. Our analysis reveals that catalyst deactivation is rather complex and is strongly affected by the enrichment of lattice Al in the intersections, the overall Al-content, and crystal size. The intergrowth of MFI and MEL phases accelerates the catalyst deactivation rate.",

They measured different quantities with high sampling rates such as shear stress and the axial displacement. The enclosed datasets consist of the raw data from five individual experiments (u572, u573, u574, u828, and u829).

        "description": "In the Groningen gas field of the Netherlands, induced seismic events have occurred since the 1990s. The strongest event occurred in 2012 with a magnitude of MW 3.6. How faults slip during such small magnitude earthquakes (i.e., magnitude 3 \u2013 4) is not clear, despite several recent studies. We conduct laboratory experiments to simulate the pulse-like (i.e. short but rapid) fault slip behavior characteristic for small magnitude human-induced seismicity, using a newly designed experimental set-up enabling monitoring of the slip behavior under stress and displacement closer to conditions relevant to faults in Groningen. The enclosed dataset, \"Data submitted to 4TU.Researchdata\" is the compressed file ('.rar'), which consists of 1) a table listing the information of all the experiments, 2) 82 data files ('.txt') of the smoothed data (~every 66 datapoints) for all the experiments. Note that one single experiment may contain 2-5 files (i.e. segments of records), and 3) 198 graphs showing the preliminary results ('.emf'). The title of the individual graphs correspond to the names of the data files. The dataset \"RawData submitted to 4TU.Researchdata\" contains the raw data of the 82 data files ('.csv').",

The borehole DAPGEO-02 makes up the central location of a seismic monitoring. It was drilled to a total depth of 499 m between February and May 2022 and equipped with geophones. Adjacent to it lays a borehole of 200 m depth and two shallower wells 100 m offset from the central borehole. These local monitoring network has been equipped with geophones and optical fibers which connect the boreholes laterally and are also placed downhole. Please refer to the final drilling report for more details. A total of 87 cores have been collected of which 18 cores are from the Maassluis Formation (between 115 and 225 m depth) and 69 cores are from several Paleogene Formations (between 362 m and 415 m depth). Open-hole wireline logging was conducted in three phases from which various types of geophysical logs were collected. In addition, two geophones were installed at 440 m and 490 m depth for seismic monitoring. This initial dataset includes: Drillers borehole records, Inventories of cores, drill cuttings, core shoe samples, and Raw wireline logs.

The objective is to assess the physicochemical properties of leonardite humic acid [LHA]-derived graphene oxide compared to commercially available graphene oxide [CGO]. A comprehensive set of analytical techniques, including XPS, XRD, FTIR, Raman, SEM, and TGA have been taken to characterize the above systematically. GO synthesized from leonardite humic acid shows structural and morphological similarities to conventional graphite oxide, including thin sheets, surface wrinkles, and defects. Both materials consist of carbon sheets with oxygen-containing functional groups, such as epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups. Analysis confirms the successful transformation of LHA into GO, revealing a highly ordered, graphene-like carbon structure. This method emphasizes environmental benefits by turning waste into wealth, reducing resource extraction, and minimizing ecological impact.<br>",

        "description": "The presented dataset used for the experiments is described in the article \"Loss function inversion for improved crack segmentation in steel bridges using a CNN framework\" (doi:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.autcon.2024.105896). The dataset consists of images of steel bridge structures and pixel-wise fatigue crack annotations. Some of the images contain bridge structures with cracks or corrosion, while others capture structures without any defect.\u00a0The images are provided by bridge infrastructure owners \"Rijkswatersaat\" and \"ProRail\" and by \"Nebest\" engineering company. The annotation of images was made using a semi-automatic annotation tool described in the article \"Segmentation Tool for Images of Cracks\" (doi:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-031-35399-4_8) and which implementation is available at https:\/\/github.com\/akomp22\/crack-segmentation-tool.The dataset consists of high-resolution images and is stored in the folder \"entire images\". The images are divided into test and train sets. Images that capture cracks are stored in the folder \"crack_train\" and \"crack_test\". Images capturing structure without a crack are stored in folders \"nocrack_train\" and \"nocrack_test\". For each image, a .json file is stored in the same folder and under the same name as the corresponding image. The .json file stores the position (x,y) of pixels on the image, which lie in a crack region. An example of a code to generate a binary segmentation map from the .json files is given in the \"read_json_annotation.py\" file.Additional patch datasets were generated from the entire images. The patch datasets are stored in the \u201cpatch dataset\u201d folder.

The research aims to address significant gaps in the understanding of the behaviour of Dutch soft organic clays under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. It focuses on stress-induced plastic anisotropy, the role of organic matter, and the impact of initial stress states in Dutch soft organic clays. Further, it aims to contribute to the field by: conducting experimental tests, Refining existing models, and Developing advanced testing apparatus: Setting up an innovative cyclic shear apparatus called CYC-DoSS. This apparatus aims to provide high-frequency, multi-directional, and complex cyclic loading patterns. Equipped with state-of-the-art measurement systems like bender elements, accelerometers, and pore pressure transducers, it will yield a unique and reliable dataset for model development, calibration, and validation. This addresses existing limitations in current equipment, which cannot control or measure lateral stresses or offer nuanced insights into hydromechanical coupling.

Raw data set of the experiments<\/strong>The goal of the evaluation of the wasp-inspired biopsy needle was twofold: 1) assessing the core-transport capability (excel tabs: \"Test 1A\", \"Results 1A\", \"Test 1B\", \"Results 1B\") and 2) assessing the self-propulsion ability (excel tabs: \"Test 2\", \"Results 2\"). These objectives were addressed in two separate experiments. Experiment 1 focused on core transport while Experiment 2 focused on self-propulsion. During testing, the setup involved moving tissue phantoms towards the prototype to enable keeping the prototype stationary. This contrasts a realistic scenario where the needle would advance through tissue, but since the relative movement between the needle and the tissue phantom is the same, it was assumed that this would not influence the test results.<br><strong>S2 Video. Proof-of-principle of sequential self-propulsion and tissue-transport<\/strong>As a proof of principle, it was assessed whether the self-propulsion and core transport could be performed sequentially. Using the set-up of Experiment 2, the wasp-inspired biopsy needle was inserted 20 mm into a gelatin block (10 wt%), measuring 80 mm in total length. The motor was turned on, allowing the needle to self-propel over a distance of 45 mm, after which the central needle segment was removed by pulling it out to allow for core extraction over the remaining 15 mm, yielding a core of 15 mm. The near-frictionless air track was then deactivated, immobilizing the gelatin block as the gelatin core was transported from the distal tip to the opening in the outer cone of the actuator.Excel tab: \"Test 3\"",

        "title": "Empirical research for the hydraulic stability of rock-filled mesh bags in offshore application for the stabilisation of cable protection systems",
        "description": "The expanding offshore wind industry is facing challenges with excessive movement of the power cables that connect offshore turbines to the grid. The casings that surround the exposed parts of cables near structures, known as cable protection systems (CPS), show damage before the end of their expected service life, requiring costly repair and maintenance. A potential solution is to stabilise the CPS by placing one or more rock-filled mesh bag (rock bag) on top of it. There are multiple rock bag manufacturers and distributors. The bags are made of polyester netting that is relatively flexible. The sizes considered for this study are 4 and 8 ton (4000 and 8000 kg), but smaller and larger sizes are available. Currently, little is known about the behaviour and stability of these rock bags in offshore environments. The goal of this study is to expand the knowledge through empirical model testing.480 experiments were conducted in a flume in the hydraulic engineering laboratory of Delft University of Technology. Two set-ups were used, one with a flat rough bed, to test two or three rock bags side by side and grouped formations of bags. The other is a realistic halved model of a monopile, scour protection and CPS. Regular wave, irregular wave and combined wave-current conditions have been tested.Analysis of before and after top images of the tests is used to establish a failure criterion. The test results are compared to the empirical stability limit defined by Jacobsen et al. (2023). In this way, a stability limit applicable for irregular wave fields is found. The effects of grouping and near monopile flow amplification are quantified. Internal friction is found to be a relevant parameter that should be considered in physical model studies.This data serves to back up all conclusions reached in the experiments and allows for changing the stability calculations by providing all relevant inputs. All libraries, scripts and processed data are provided.

        "title": "Test data underlying the PhD thesis: Characterization of the mechanical properties of wooden foundation piles (G. Pagella) - TU DELFT",
        "description": "An extensive experimental campaign was conducted in this PhD research to characterize the mechanical properties along: 70 \u201cnew\u201d full-size saturated spruce (<em>Picea abies<\/em>) and pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris<\/em>) foundation piles; 60 historical full-size saturated spruce (Picea abies) and fir (Abies) piles retrieved from two bridges in the city of Amsterdam, 100-300 years old and with different levels of decay. The data were collected from the experimental test campaign on the wooden foundation piles extracted from the soil in Amsterdam. The following methodology is adopted for achieving the main goals:The mechanical properties along the full-size \u201cnew\u201d piles are investigated through the execution of large-scale axial compression tests on pile segments, extracted from their head, middle-part and tip. Pile segments with different diameters are investigated (ranging from 130 mm to 280 mm), with the goal of investigating the variability of saturated compressive strength and stiffness along the pile. The relationships between the saturated compressive strength and parameters characterized with visual and machine grading were investigated. On this basis, possible strength classes for the characteristic compressive strength based on visually-graded parameters were determined for spruce and pine piles. The results provide a basis for the engineering design and assessment of timber foundation piles and they can be used together with the provisions given in the new standard (Eurocode 5 2023).The second objective of this work is the detailed characterization, in terms of material and mechanical properties, of the historical saturated piles, with specific reference to the influence of bacterial decay on their remaining saturated compressive strength. The historical piles have been exposed in the soil for approximately 100, 135 and 295 years. Thus, it is possible to assess the remaining compressive strength of the piles in relation to bacterial decay after three distinct periods of service time. Large-scale compressive tests on full-size segments extracted from head, middle-part and tip were conducted to study the effect of decay along the pile. Small-scale compression tests were carried out on samples retrieved from the pile\u2019s cross section, to study the influence of decay radially within the pile. Several techniques are adopted for this characterisation: micro-drilling measurements, computer tomography (CT) scans, and light microscopy observations.The applicability of micro-drilling measurements is studied to assess the amount of decay in the historical piles, as an alternative to the current extraction of drill cores. Correlations between the material and mechanical properties of the samples and the micro-drilling signals are investigated, to check the reliability of micro-drilling in identifying decay both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. Based on a large database of micro-drilling signals collected from every historical pile segment, an algorithm is developed to determine the amount of decay within the pile at the position of the measurement.Two prediction models are presented: one for the saturated compressive strength of \u201cnew\u201d spruce and pine piles, based on machine grading of their dynamic modulus of elasticity, measurable in practice with frequency response measurements. One for the direct prediction of the remaining saturated compressive strength along in-situ historical timber piles, based on the remaining sound cross-sectional area determined with underwater micro-drilling performed on the pile head.The novelty of this research lies in the characterization of the mechanical properties along the length of saturated spruce and pine piles, providing reliable saturated compressive strength values and grading specifications which enable engineers to adequately design timber foundation piles. These values can be used together with the provisions in the new Eurocode 5 2023. An innovative application of micro-drilling measurements is introduced, for the in-situ assessment of historical timber foundation piles and estimation of their remaining short-term compressive strength. This serves as basis for engineering retrofitting of timber foundations currently in use under historic buildings and strategical structures such bridges and quay walls in the city of Amsterdam. The micro-drilling approach contributes to the research framework in the city of Amsterdam, supporting testing and modelling methods for estimating decay, (residual) load-carrying capacity, and remaining service life models of timber pile foundations. This knowledge has broader applicability and potential extension to de delta cities across European countries, such as Stockholm (SE), Hamburg (DE) and Venice (IT), but also overseas locations including Boston (US).",

        "description": "In landfill foundation treatment, high-level radioactive waste disposal, geothermal resources development and utilization and other engineering construction practice, there is a large amount of unsaturated soil. When unsaturated soil is affected by sunlight, geothermal, nuclear waste, biochemical reaction and other thermal radiation, it will accelerate the settlement and deformation of soil temperature. The building structure based on unsaturated soil will also be affected, so it is of great significance to study the influence of temperature on the stress and deformation of unsaturated soil. In this paper, by extending the SFG model of unified yield surface to consider the influence of temperature change on unified yield surface, a yield surface constitutive model which can reflect temperature-suction-stress at the same time is proposed.In order to verify the applicability of the model, triaxial tests on Jiangxi laterite at different temperatures are carried out to determine the parameters needed for model calculation. The model fitting results are obtained by using the test parameters and compared with the test results. With reference to the experimental data of remolded clay used in the literature by Uchaipichat et al, the model was fitted and analyzed. The results show that the unified yield surface SFG model considering the effect of temperature can better reflect the stress-strain characteristics of soil during compression rebound, dehumidification and shear, and verify the reliability of the constitutive model to reflect the stress-strain characteristics of soil at different temperatures, thus further enriching the constitutive theory of unsaturated soil under the influence of temperature.",

        "description": "<em>Reserach data used in the following publication:<\/em><strong>Tires for Mars Rovers: Reinforcing BR and BR\/Vinyl-Methyl Silicone Rubber Compounds with Carbon Black, Nano-CaCO3, or Silica for Good Low-Temperature Dynamic-Mechanical Performance<\/strong><em>Abstract:<\/em>Dynamic increment in Mars exploration missions necessitates the development of new materials that can satisfy the ever more stringent requirements. Currently, most of the materials used for manufacturing Mars rovers and landers are based on various metal alloys that provide high reliability in the Martian environment. However, the future planned missions, including the first human crew landing on Mars, require the development of new rubber materials that could be used for sealing Mars suits, for tires\/tracks, and for damping systems for heavy Mars rovers. This research aims to investigate the properties of butadiene rubber (BR) and butadiene\/vinyl-methyl silicone rubber blends (BR\/VMQ) filled with various reinforcing fillers: carbon blacks (CBs), silicas, and nanometric calcium carbonate (nano-CaCO<sub>3<\/sub>), in order to evaluate their performance from the point of view of Mars' environmental applications. The study revealed that the designed composites exhibit very good low-temperature elasticity, and the addition of 30 phr of high surface area CB (N220) or silica (Ultrasil 9100) results in good mechanical properties of the compounds. The mechanical properties of the BR\/VMQ blends depend on the type of reinforcing filler. The addition of the CBs resulted in better mechanical properties, while the incorporation of silicas worsens the mechanical properties of BR\/VMQ blends in comparison to their BR counterparts. The high-cis BR grade exhibits a strong tendency to crystallize in the operating temperature range on Mars (crystallization \u223c\u221260 \u00b0C, melting \u223c\u221220 \u00b0C), and the addition of the fillers nucleates the crystallization, resulting in a higher amount of the crystalline phase. This might be a serious problem for any sealing application of the rubber compounds. For this reason, a non-crystallizable BR grade is recommended for further studies.",

The tool consists of an undiagnostic flint flake embedded in a thick piece of birch tar dating from the Middle Palaeolithic. It is a significant find because 1) it is the first to be discovered in the Netherlands and the 5th in Europe and 2) both the composite nature of the tool and the presence of tar which resulted from a complex transformative technology illustrates the Neandertal intellectual capacities. This is the first ever tar backed tool which has been securely dated, chemically analysed, subjected to optical microscopy wear analysis, and scanned with a X-ray micro-CT scanner. All analyses are presented and discussed in a multidisciplinary article written by Niekus et al.. The article has been submitted for review shortly after the scan data has been published in the 4TU Centre for Research Data. The micro-CT scan data which reveals the inner structure of the tar, the flint and the morphology of the flint-tar interface is presented as supplementary material to the article. The data set is made of 5 types of files: - Images of the digitally reconstructed tool in dcm format (dicom files). The images can be used to visualize the tool in 3D with public domain open source software ImageJ. They can also be further post-processed. Upon request the raw scan data (before re-construction) can be provided. - The surface meshes of the flint and the tar in obj and ud3 formats. The surfaces can be inspected separately in 3D using public domain open source software Meshlab. They can also be 3D printed. - A video in wmv format allowing to explore the inner and outer structure of the tool. - A pdf describing features displayed in the video. - A pdf containing the meta-data related to the scan and the data processing.",

        "description": "In the water laboratory three models were tested. Firstly, model 3 of Kik is repeated as model 3A, with a calculated value of notional permeability P 0.38. The construction of model 3A is build with a top layer, filter layer 1, filter layer 2 and a impermeable core. Second, another variant of model 3 of Kik is designed and tested (model 4). However, the measured damage figures were too low and therefore they could not be used to calculate a value for the notional permeability P. The construction of model four is build with a top layer, filter layer 1, filter layer 2 which is thicker as model 3A and an impermeable core. Finally, model 5 is tested with a calculated value of notional permeability of P 0.45. This model is designed from the fourth construction of Van der Meer. The construction of model 5 is build with a top layer, filter layer 1 and a permeable core with the same material of filter layer 2 of model 3A and model 4. The results of this research show that the influences of the notional permeability P exists of the ratio of the armour layer thickness and the thickness of the second filter layer. If the layer thicknesses are equal the value for notional permeability P is 0.38, which follows from model 3A. If the second layer has an infinite thickness (permeable core), the value for notional permeability P is 0.45, which follows from model 5. The value of the notional permeability P of model 5 corresponds to the design calculations of the computer model HADEER. Van der Meer discovered using this computer model that the ratio of dn50a\/ dn50f = 5 has a value on the notional permeability P of 0.43 \u20130.44. During this research, while using two different methods, a value of the notional permeability P of 0.45 was calculated.",

        "description": "The Delft University of Technology provided the laboratory facilities to carry out physical model tests on a wide graded rubble mound structure representative of the core of a breakwater. The parameter D85\/D15, describing the stone-size gradation of the construction material, was varied between the values 2.71 and 17.7, and two different seaward slopes of the model structure were also tested. The reshaped cross-shore profiles measured during the tests showed how if the grading increases the stability of the structure is reduced. In conclusion, this research points out how the formulas provided by the technical literature are not reliable in representing the effects of a very wide stone-size gradation in the stability of a rubble mound structure. Physical model tests proved to be a suited way to investigate these effects, as the nature of the phenomena who play a role in the stability does not allow a simple analytical representation. The tests carried out within the present study lead to the implementation of a numerical model of practical use for engineers and contractors: further investigations through laboratory tests are recommended to validate and extend the findings of this study. Another proposed direction for further research is the comparison between the results of physical model tests and the output of numerical models.",

        "title": "Hydraulic properties of PUR-revetments compared to those of open stone asphalt revetments",
        "description": "Elastocoast is a special elastomeric polyurethane system made by Elastogran. It binds broken rocks or stones together to form a stable material which is not only solid but also elastic so that it is able to be an ideal material for hydraulic applications. As a new developed material for revetment, the performance of Elastocoast in the application of revetments is still unknown. This research is carried out to study the feasibility of the Elasatocoast's applications as revetments. Due to the similarities between Elastocoast and open stone asphalt, most of the experiments are done according to the concerning problems of the open stone asphalt revetments. Five properties were tested: porosity, permeability between the material and geotextile, wave run-up, stability on slope and resistance to erosion. It turned out that compared to open stone asphalt Elastocoast is a strong and permeable material and it is relatively easy to construct and maintain. It is expected to be a suitable material as revetment.",

        "description": "We synthesize graphene by ball milling of synthetic graphite (graphite with 99.9% purity (Mesh # 100)) and solid CO2 (dry ice) as a precursor for 24 hours. The materials obtained were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental chemical analysis by energy dispersion x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). In addition, it was determined that the compounds obtained possess between 6 and 14 graphene sheets, depending on the grinding time. These determinations were determined by means of XRD, and the results were corroborated with Raman spectroscopy. The composition of the materials obtained is 92% carbon and approximately 8% oxygen through EDS and XPS measurements. From X-ray diffraction using Mo (K\u03b1), structural analysis for non-crystalline systems by means of the radial distribution function RDF(r) and total distribution function T(r) was realized to determine the coordination numbers as well as atomic distances within short-range order (SRO) in the obtained material, with a structural disorder parameter (\u03be) of approximately 3.5. Then, the graphene base structure was modelled for the 24-hour sample. The TEM results confirm that different deformed graphene constituent planes in the observed graphene nanoplatelet (GnP) arrangement were obtained, which were caused by the tensions imposed during the material synthesis process in significant quantities by ball milling.",

        "description": "Pore-pressure depletion in sandstone reservoirs is well known to cause both elastic and inelastic compaction, often resulting in notable surface subsidence and induced seismicity. Recent studies indicate that in such cases inelastic strain, which is often neglected in geomechanical models, represents a significant proportion of the total strain throughout reservoir production. While there has been considerable effort to quantify the proportion of continuous inelastic deformation from the mechanical response of laboratory samples, there has been little focus to date on the associated acoustic response throughout compaction. With this in mind, we employ three coda-wave based processing methods for the active source monitoring of ultrasonic velocity, scattering power, and intrinsic\/scattering attenuation during the pore-pressure depletion of core samples from the Slochteren sandstone reservoir in the Groningen gas field (the Netherlands). Our results corroborate previous studies suggesting that initially, inelastic deformation occurs primarily along intergranular boundaries, with intergranular cracking developing towards the end of depletion and particularly for the highest porosity samples. Furthermore, analysis of Biot type intrinsic attenuation indicates that this compaction occurs in several stages of predominately intergranular closure, transitioning into primarily intergranular slip\/cracking, and eventually porosity-dependent intragranular cracking. We demonstrate how this segmentation of pore-pressure driven compaction can be used to characterise differences in sample properties, and monitor the evolution of microstructural inelastic deformation throughout depletion. We further discuss the feasibility of in\/cross-borehole monitoring of reservoir compaction, for both improved geo-mechanical modelling and early warning detection of induced seismicity.",

        "title": "High resolution bed level change and synchronized biophysical data from 10 tidal flats in northwestern Europe",
        "description": "Tidal flats provide valuable ecosystem services such as flood protection and carbon sequestration. Erosion and accretion processes govern the eco-geomorphic evolution of intertidal ecosystems (marshes and bare flats), and hence substantially affect their valuable ecosystem services. To understand the intertidal ecosystem development, high-frequency bed-level change data are thus needed. However, such datasets are scarce due to the lack of suitable methods that do not involve excessive labour and\/or instrument cost. By applying newly-developed Surface Elevation Dynamics sensors (SED-sensors), we obtained unique high-resolution daily bed-level change data sets in the period 2013-2017 from 10 saltmarsh sites situated in the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain in contrasting physical and biological settings. At each site, multiple sensors were deployed for 9-20 months to ensure sufficient spatial and temporal coverage of highly variable bed level change processes. The bed level change data are provided with synchronized hydrodynamic data, i.e. water level, wave height, tidal current velocity, and medium grain size (D50) as well as (for some sites) chlorophyll-a level and organic matter content of the surface sediment. This dataset has revealed diverse spatial morphodynamic patterns over daily to seasonal scales, which are valuable to theoretical and model development. On the daily scale, this dataset is particularly instructive as it includes a number of storm events, the response to which can be detected in the bed level change observations. Such data are rare but useful to study tidal flat response to highly energetic conditions.",

        "description": "This work aimed at investigating the presence of disseminated neoplasia in the Baltic clam Limecola balthica. We conducted a field survey in the Dutch Wadden Sea (10 sampling sites) to determine the prevalence of the disease in Baltic tellins in the Wadden Sea and to quantify its severity via histology. Briefly, bivalves were sampled by brushing away the first 10 cm of the sediment surface. Organisms were then collected by hand and keep in the Davidson\u2019s fixative on back in the lab. Tissues of samples were then collected and embedded in paraffin blocks. Histological sections of 5 \u00b5m thickness were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and the slides examined for the presence of disseminated neoplasia using light microscopy. If neoplastic cells were present, we determined the disease severity according to Christensen et al. (1974) and Pekkarinen (1993) as follows: stage 1, local neoplastic cells noticed in the gills; stage 2, gills totally invaded with neoplastic cells; stage 3, spots of neoplastic cells in other tissues than gills, and stage 4, widespread neoplastic cells. For each sampling site, we calculated the prevalence of the disease and the prevalence of each stage of the disease. The data set is an excel file, with different columns, specifying where and when bivalves were sampled, the type of environment (sandy mud, muddy sand or sand), the density of the bivalve at each location, and the stage of the disease (O to 4).",

        "description": "Foraminiferal trace element concentrations were determined using two laser ablation ICP-MS systems. Prior to laser ablation, all samples were gently cleaned in methanol (x1) and UHQ water (x4). Between each rinse, the samples were placed in a sonic bath for several seconds to thoroughly clean the tests. Benthic foraminifera from 745m (station D), 980m (station C), 1488m (station B), and 1987m (station A) were measured at Utrecht University using a deep UV (193 nm) ArF excimer laser (Lambda Physik) with GeoLas 200Q optics. Ablation was performed at a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz and an energy density of 1.4 J\/cm\u00b2, with a crater size of 80 \u03bcm. Ablated particles were measured by a quadrupole ICP-MS (Micromass Platform) equipped with a collision and reaction cell. Such a collision and reaction cell improves carbonate analyses by eliminating interferences on mass 44. Scanned masses included 24Mg, 26Mg, 27Al, 42Ca, 43Ca, 55Mn, 88Sr, 137Ba, 138Ba, and 208Pb. Benthic foraminifera from stations F (350 m) and E (552 m) were analyzed at ETH Zurich (due to laboratory renovations at Utrecht University). The laser type and ablation parameters were identical to those detailed above. The ablated particles were measured using a quadrupole ICP-MS (ELAN 6100 DRC, PerkinElmer). In both cases, calibration was performed using an international standard (NIST610) with Ca as an internal standard (Jochum et al., 2011). The same masses as measured in Utrecht were monitored, in addition to 7Li, 23Na, 47Ti, 60Ni, 61Ni, and 89Y. Interlaboratory compatibility was monitored using a matrix-matched calcite standard. For Mn, reported here, this standard showed a precision better than 3%over all analyses, at ETH and UU, and with an offset of less than 5%from an offline-determined (solution ICP-AES) concentration analyzing discrete subsamples. The matrix-matched standard is routinely included in the analyses and has been monitored since 2010 at Utrecht University. Analytical error (equivalent to 1 sigma), based on repeated measurement of an external standard, was &lt; 5% for reported elements. Each laser ablation measurement was screened for contamination by monitoring Al and Pb. On encountering surface contamination, the data integration interval was adjusted to exclude any Al or Pb enrichment. Cross-plots between Al and Pb versus Mn showed that they are unrelated, confirming the accuracy of the integrations.",

Experiments are carried out using a wave overtopping simulator. This device is developed to create full scale overtopping conditions on a inner slope. Experiments show initiation of erosion of the grass layer downstream of the transition of the slope and a horizontal part. The focus of the present research is modelling of the erosion process at a transition. The erosion process is described by two different models. The Transition Model (TM) is derived to describe the development of the scour hole due to the impinging forces of the overtopping wave tongue, known as surface erosion; The SSEA (Sites Spillway Erosion Analysis) model is taken to describe the headcut erosion process which occurs after the scour hole has reached a certain depth. The TM is based on a oblique impinging jet and a depth variable strength profile, in where near the surface the root system dominates, whereas with increasing depths cohesion and internal friction of the clay dominates.",

        "description": "The design formula for rubble mound breakwaters by Van der Meer has an unclear Notional Permeability term. This term causes a lot of confusion for designers. In the past many people have tried to derive a better formulation for that term by experimental and analytical research. The goal of this study was to obtain a better formulation along a numerical way. This study explores the numerical possibilities and tries to define which direction has to be taken in future research. As a first step, a very simplified case is taken with a vertical homogeneous breakwater which interact with monochromatic waves. In total six different blocks were made of epoxy and elastocoast. Only 4 out of the 6 blocks were tested. Also the porosity (n), laminar friction (\u03b1) and turbulent friction constant (\u03b2) of the blocks were determined experimentally. This way the experimental results could be compared with computations. These experiments have been done in the large flume of the Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the TU Delft. Two types of data were collected: pore pressures and water levels in front and behind the block. The water levels seemed to be the most reliable data. The main deficit of the setup was the wave absorber at the end of the flume. The wave absorber is not able to sufficiently absorb long waves. So the dataset had to be corrected for that effect. The created dataset was in line with results from earlier experiments.",

        "title": "Erosion tests with the annular flume",
        "description": "To predict the changes of natural systems like estuaries and tidal lagoons as a consequence of human interferences often numerical models are applied. An important aspect is the erosion and transport of sediment. Therefore, these models require formulations that describe the erosion of the sediment bed consisting of sand, mud and organic matter. A physically founded and validated process-based description of these mixed sediments is still missing. Recently, a theoretically derived formulation for erosion of mixed sediments has been proposed. However, a proper validation of this new formula is lacking. Therefore, a systematic study has been undertaken. First, studies have been executed to investigate the individually physical properties in this formula. Next, erosion tests have been executed on a large number of varying sample compositions using a straight, re-circulating flume. The effect of sediment structures and cohesiveness of the sediment bed has been investigated, from which the new formulations could be qualified. However, this experimental set-up was relatively small, with possible large influences of e.g. boundary effects. Therefore, another set of erosion experiments had to be carried out to supplement the results of the mentioned tests. The objective of this study was to quantify the newly defined theorem for the erosion behavior of sand-mud mixtures. The experiments were carried out on three different artificially generated sand-silt-clay mixtures, using a large annular flume. The mixtures were homogeneously mixed and 100% saturated and, subsequently, placed in the flume. A unidirectional flow was generated by rotating the top-lid and the flume in opposite directions. The flow-induced shear stresses near the bottom were varied by increasing the rotational speeds step by step. An observation on the erosion behavior of the beds was carried out, as well as the measurement of the concentration of suspended fines over the vertical. Due to the occurring secondary currents, the eroded sand accumulated along the outer bend of the flume. By collecting this the amount of eroded sand was quantified. The shear stresses near the bottom were not measured directly, but were determined by means of a large eddy simulation model. The results show two parts regarding the erosion behavior of the mixtures. Before the complete failure of the bed (part 2), different modes of erosion were identified in which only small amounts of material were eroded (part 1). Mainly due to the placement of the bed, the bed strength was slightly varying in the upper part of the sediment bed concerning both the horizontal as the vertical direction. In this first part floc erosion occurred for the fines. Sand was transported as bed load as well as in the sheet flow regime. For this part, the concentration of eroded fines showed a typically non-linear increase as usually occurred for erosion tests with deposited beds. Several possible explanations for this unexpected behavior are discussed. For part 2, surface erosion was observed, during which the concentration was increasing linearly with time. The erosion rate as function of bed shear stresses revealed that the threshold of erosion for samples with a sand-silt skeleton was relatively high, while the threshold for the sample with the clay-water matrix was lower. A transition in erosion behavior was observed when regarding the erosion parameters for both fines and sand. This transition occurred for a plasticity index of around seven, which agrees well with the transition in mechanical behavior for sand-dominated to clay-dominated sediment as found in previous empirical geotechnical studies.",

Effective technologies to remove these micropollutants from water include adsorption onto granular activated carbon in fixed-bed filters. The rate-determining step in adsorption using activated carbon is usually the adsorbate diffusion inside the porous adsorbent. The presence of mesopores can facilitate diffusion, resulting in higher adsorption rates.We used two different types of granular activated carbon, with and without mesopores, to study the adsorption rate of hydrophilic micropollutants. Furthermore, equilibrium studies were performed to determine the affinity of the selected micropollutants for the activated carbons. A pore diffusion model was applied to the kinetic data to obtain pore diffusion coefficients. We observed that the adsorption rate is influenced by the molecular size of the micropollutant as well as the granular activated carbon pore size.",

        "description": "The scope of this thesis is to find an empirical formula to describe the distribution of overtopping at the space behind the crest. In this research, a physical model was developed on which irregular waves are tested. Because of the duration of the tests and the amount of collected water (significant lose of water during the test), a completely new measuring system was designed. Five influencing parameters (variables) are considered on this research: wave height, wave period\/steepness, slope angle, crest freeboard and crest permeability. The entire overtopping process is analysed separately for the total overtopping discharge, the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest and the distribution of overtopping behind the structure. In the analysis of the data collected from the measurements, the impact of the varying parameters is investigated leading to useful conclusions and better understanding of the entire process. Additionally, the experimental findings are analysed and compared to the relative existing methods.",

        "description": "Silicon carbide (SiC) membranes have shown large potential for applications in water treatment. Being able to make these membranes in a hollow fiber geometry allows for higher surface-to-volume ratios. In this study, we present a thermal treatment procedure that is tuned to produce porous silicon carbide hollow fiber membranes with sufficient mechanical strength. Thermal treatments up to 1500 \u00b0C in either nitrogen or argon resulted in relatively strong fibers, that were still contaminated with residual carbon from the polymer binder. After treatment at a higher temperature of 1790 \u00b0C, the mechanical strength had decreased as a result of carbon removal, but after treatments at even higher temperature of 2075 \u00b0C the SiC-particles sinter together, resulting in fibers with mechanical strengths of 30\u201340 MPa and exceptionally high water permeabilities of 50,000 L m\u22122 h\u22121 bar\u22121. In this supplementary video we demonstrate the mechanical robustness and extreme clean water fluxes in a visual manner.",

To define the pore system precisely, mercury intrusion porosimetry as well as gas adsorption is performed. According to the data, the entire pore volume distribution is known.

        "title": "Wave overtopping at rubble mound breakwaters with a non-reshaping berm",
        "description": "Wave overtopping was investigated by means of a physical model. The breakwater scale model was divided into 8 collection bins. Overtopped volumes were collected and pumped into floating tanks further down the flume. After the experiment the mass of the floating tanks was measured and the mean overtopping discharge could be determined for 8 horizontal positions on the breakwater. The measured total overtopping discharges cannot be predicted accurately by existing prediction methods. On the basis of experimental data a new prediction method was proposed that achieves an excellent fit for total overtopping. The crest freeboard definition was adjusted to account for the permeability of the crest. The reduction factor accounting for slope roughness was made dependent on the Iribarren number. For Iribarren numbers higher than 6, this method calculates no reduction of overtopping due to slope roughness. The effect of a permeable berm on total overtopping was found to be remarkably different from the effect of an impermeable berm. Permeable berms below Still Water Level (SWL) lead to less reduction of overtopping than impermeable berms below SWL. Berms above SWL lead to wave breaking on the slope in front of the berm. Contrarily to impermeable berms above SWL, a permeable berm above SWL leads to significant reduction of overtopping. The measured spatial distribution of overtopping is associated with a lot of seemingly random behaviour. Large differences were found with the experimental data of Lioutas (2010). It is suspected that the used experiment setup gives rise to significant model effects for the spatial distribution of overtopping. An experiment setup was recommended that is expected to more accurately model the behaviour of the prototype situation. Data on the spatial distribution of overtopping could not accurately be predicted by existing prediction methods. In some cases existing prediction methods provided an upper limit for overtopping (Juul Jensen, 1984) but none led to a good fit with the experimental data. A new reduction factor was found that reduces the amount of scatter and provides a conservative prediction of the experimental data.",

        "description": "Using active ultrasonic source survey data, Coda-wave Decorrelation (CWD) time-lapse imaging during the triaxial compression of Whitby Mudstone cores provides a 3-D description of the evolution and redistribution of inelastic strain concentrations. Acoustic Emissions (AEs) monitoring is also performed between any two consecutive surveys. From these data, we investigate the impact of initial water saturation $S_w$ on the onset, growth, and reactivation of inelastic deformation, compared to the post-deformation fracture network extracted from X-ray tomography scans. Our results indicate for the applied strain-rate and degree of initial water saturation, and within the frequency range of our ultrasonic transducers (0.1 to 1 MHz), that inelastic strain localisation and propagation in the Whitby Mudstone does not radiate AEs of sufficient magnitude to be detected above the average noise level. This is true for both the initial onset of inelasticity (strain localisation), and during macroscopic failure. In contrast, the CWD results indicate the onset of what is interpreted as localised regions of inelastic strain at less than fifty percent of the peak differential stress the Whitby Mudstone can sustain. The seemingly aseismic nature of these clay-rich rocks suggests the gradual development of inelastic strain, from the microscopic diffuse damage, up until the macroscopic shear failure.",

However, for single layer interlocking armour units the influence core permeability is rather unfamiliar. The goal of this research is to extend the knowledge on the failure mechanism of the armour layer for different structural permeability. To achieve this goal, model tests are conducted in the permeameter of the Technical University of Delft and in the wave flume of Delta Marine Consultants, Utrecht. The tests show that the stability of the armour layer decreases with increasing and decreasing core permeability.",

        "description": "Application of Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis (NLFEA) is lagging behind the many digital advances in the structural engineering practice. This is due to the need for codes and standards. To help development of these codes and standards, 19 solution strategies were developed by varying the cracking model, element size, reinforcement model and equilibrium aspects. The constants aspects of the constitutive model, like confinement and the reduction compressive strength due to lateral cracking, are based on the RTD1016 Dutch Guideline. All models are two-dimensional with a plane stress assumption and in all cases the analysis is force controlled with the application of an arclength method.\\\\ The strategies were benchmarked with 101 experiments on reinforced concrete beams selected from literature. Those beams cover a broad range of design aspects, failing both in shear and bending, reinforcement configurations with- and without shear reinforcement, both prestressed and conventional reinforcement and heights ranging from 90 to 1200 mm.\\\\ This resulted in 1919 NLFEAs which were performed with an automated approach in the DIANA multi-purpose finite element software package. It was concluded that the failure load and failure mode of the experiments can be approximated with a mean uncertainty of 1.05 with a coefficient of variation around 10 percent, provided that an appropriate solution strategy is applied. It is possible to assign an appropriate solution strategy when the structural design is known, where the main influence is the presence of shear reinforcement. Beams with stirrups are robustly modelled by a rotating crack model, while beams without stirrups were found to be better approximated by a fixed crack approach with specific choices regarding reinforcement modelling and equilibrium.\\\\ To have a more objective way of judging the ductility of a failure, a measure of the dissipated energy in the reinforcement was implemented in the DIANA code. It was found that the mean model uncertainty of a ductile failure can be as low as 1.045, with a coefficient of variation around 10 percent. Brittle failures showed a mean uncertainty of 1.131, with a coefficient of variation just below 16 percent. Therefore the ductility index was found to be a valid way to judge the reliability of an NLFEA result.\\\\ This study has demonstrated the applicability of force controlled NLFEA for reinforced concrete beams. The derived properties of the model uncertainties are a crucial input for safety formats.",

As the fine dust in these areas is the main cause of clogging, the pavement behavior under this condition was evaluated by the lab experiment. During the lab experiment different sub-bases (sand and stone) were also examined to see the differences in clogging process under various conditions. The results from this research shows that the wind suspended particles, as the main cause of clogging in semi-arid areas, can be washed through the pavement and cause a very slow clogging process. Comparison the results of different sub-bases shows the significant effect of the pores size in the sub-base on the clogging process. In case of higher porous sub-base, sediments can be migrated from the pavement to the sub-base easily. But in case of less porous sub-base the blocking of the interface and first layers of the sub-base can create more resistance through the flow migration. As the clogging in case of larger particles happens rapidly, therefore in order to design the pavement, average size of particles that can go through it should be taken into account.",

        "description": "Directly coupling renewable energy to reverse osmosis may be the most cost effective solution to supply potable water to remote and isolated areas that lack infrastructure and safe drinking water. These systems do not use batteries but rather operate only when sufficient energy is available and store any excess energy as water. Since reverse osmosis membranes are designed to be operated for continuous periods under constant power, it has been unclear how the fluctuating operation will affect the performance of the membranes. In these experiments, a small-scale reverse osmosis unit (maximum production 8 m3\/day) was set up in the laboratory to continually recycle and treat a reservoir of artificial seawater (32 800 mg\/L NaCl). The power of the high pressure pump feeding the reverse osmosis membranes is fluctuated corresponding to inputs of real wind data entered through an automated computer system. Measurements of pressure, permeate production and conductivity were continually recorded and used to determine if there were changes in the membrane permeability coefficient and salt rejection of the membrane resulting from fluctuating operation. After more than 650 hours of fluctuating operation, no deterioration of reverse osmosis membrane performance was observed.",
