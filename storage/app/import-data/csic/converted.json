        "description": "We present the in situ modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of iron-rich cobalt-ferrite epitaxial islands by changing their composition. Crystalline cobalt-ferrite spinel islands have been grown by oxygen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on a Ru(0001) single crystal. The micro-crystals are several micrometers wide with heights of tens of nanometers. Their spatially-resolved vector magnetization is mapped by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in photoemission microscopy at the L3 absorption edges of Co and Fe. Thick islands present a closure-like magnetic domain structure with the magnetization directions predominantly aligned along the projections of the easy magnetic axes onto the (111) surface plane. Thinner islands are more affected by growth defects and present a more complex domain structure. Upon deposition of additional Fe in an oxygen background pressure, Co is found to segregate out of the spinel islands, while their Fe content increases. This produces a reduction in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which manifests as a reorientation of the magnetization directions towards the edges of the islands, reflecting an increased contribution of the shape anisotropy",

The samples were taken from Pico Cabras dome (Tenerife), including deposits of the sub-plinian fallout (explosive phase) and the lava flow and dome (effusive phase). The samples were analysed with a SEM Merlin Compact ZEISS with an EDS Bruker detector (QUANTAX-XFlash6-30mm2-129eV) at the ISTO Measures Physiques laboratory (CNRS, Orleans). Additionally, we performed a micro-XRF analysis using the XTRACE detector (Tube Rh \u2013 filtres Al, Ti, Ni) connected to the MEB, which was calibrated against inner Br glassy standards containing different amounts of Br (Faranda et al. 2019) in order to analyze Br in sodalite and glass in the pumice samples. Mineral phase compositions were obtained with an electron microprobe SX-FIVE, also at the ISTO. An acceleration voltage of 15kV, a sample current of 6nA, and a counting time of 10s were used. For the glasses, a defocused beam of 10\u03bcm and 20\u03bcm was used, whereas for minerals a focused beam was employed. Whole-rock data was obtained by analysing two glass samples resulting from the two-step melting (with grinding in between) of lava and pumice samples at 1400\u00baC for 4 hours in total time, respectively. The aim of the study was contributing to the understanding of the mechanisms that control the transition between explosive and effusive dynamics in dome-forming eruptions at T-PV stratovolcanoes and propose a conceptual model for the magmatic reservoir of Pico Cabras prior to eruption. In this dataset we collect all de geochemical data obtained in the study. The Excel file consists of seven sheets, each one corresponding with one of the principal phases found in the samples: feldspars, pyroxenes, biotites, magnetites, ilmenites, sodalites and glasses (including the whole-rock analysis resulting from the obsidian obtained in the melting of the samples). The four analysed samples were given a International GeoSample Number (IGSN) for their correct identification. IEODG0001, IEODG0002 and IEODG0004 are samples from the effusive phase of Pico Cabras dome eruption (the later corresponding to an obsidian sample from the dome itself). IEODG0003 are pumices samples from the explosive phase in which minerals and glass fragments were selected for analysis.",

Microscopy analyses showed diatoms dominating the phytoplankton community in the upper layers (0-20 m). Metabarcoding data from the water column showed the presence of Chytridiomycota predominantly in the upper layers coinciding with the vertical distribution of diatoms. Laboratory incubations of natural samples enriched with different diatom cultures confirmed parasitic interactions of some of those chytrids \u2013 including members of Kappamyces \u2013 with diatom taxa. The temporal dynamics of diatoms and chytrids was also explored in a three-year metabarcoding time-series (2011-2013) from surface waters of the study area and in sediment samples. Chytrids were recurrently present at low relative abundances, and some taxa found to infect diatoms in the incubation experiments were also identified in the ASV time-series. However, co-occurrence analyses did not show any clear or recurrent pairing patterns for chytrid and diatom taxa along the three years. The chytrid community in the sediments showed a clearly different species composition compared to the recorded in the water column samples, with higher diversity and relative abundance. The combination of observations, incubations and metabarcoding confirmed that parasites are a common component of marine protist communities at LTER-MC. Host-parasite interactions must be determined and quantified to understand their role and the impact they have on phytoplankton dynamics",

The study was complemented by structural, morphological, tribological, mechanical and surface analyses. It was found that carbon-containing gases were dominating. The sulfur-containing gases comprised H2S, COS and CS2. The latter two were unexpected. The emission of these gases was traced back to solid-state chemical reactions kinetically controlled by the precursor concentrations and driven through non-thermal mechanisms, which we tentatively assigned to formation of sulfur radicals.",

        "description": "Herein we show that dispersing inorganic Cesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in optical quality films, possessing an accessible and controlled pore size distribution, gives rise to fluorescent materials with a controlled and highly sensitive response to ambient changes. A scaffold based synthetic approach is employed to attain ligand-free QDs, whose pristine surface endows them with high sensitivity to the presence of different vapors in their vicinity. At the same time, the void network of the host offers a means to gradually expose the embedded QDs to such vapors. Under these conditions, the luminescent response of the QDs is mediated by the mesostructure of the matrix, which determines the rate at which vapor molecules will adsorb onto the pore walls and, eventually, condensate, filling the void space. With luminescence quantum yields as high as 60%, scaffold supported ligand-free perovskite nanocrystals display intense photoemission signals over the whole process, as well as high photo and chemical stability, which allows illuminating them for long periods of time and recovering the original response upon desorption of the condensed phase. The results herein presented open a new route to explore the application of perovskite QDs based materials in sensing.",

        "description": "This study integrates geophysical-geochemical data to investigate the thermochemical structure of the lithosphere and sublithospheric mantle, along the Southern Tyrrhenian Basin, Apennines, Adriatic Sea, Dinarides, and Carpathians-Balkanides. We present the lithospheric structure of the Adria microplate and the two opposing mantle slabs along its NE and SW margins. The modelling shows the presence of two asthenospheric mantle wedges aligning with the Apenninic and Dinaric continental mantle slab rollback, along with cold (-200\u00baC) sublithospheric anomalies beneath Adria\u2019s NE and SW margins. In the northern Adria region, the lithosphere undergoes synchronous thinning in the Tyrrhenian domain and thickening toward the forefront of the northern Apennines. This is associated with the northeastward rollback of the SW Adriatic slab, leading to subsequent delamination of the continental mantle. In the southern Adria region, the complex deep structure results from the variably oriented lithospheric slabs, and nearly 90-degree shift of the tectonic grain between the southern Apennines and the Calabrian Arc. At the SW Adria margin, beneath the northern Apennines, the thermal sublithospheric anomaly is attached to the shallower lithosphere, while a slab gap is modelled in the southern Apennines. One possibility is that the gap is due to a recent horizontal slab tear. Along the NE margin of Adria, the thermal anomaly penetrates to depths of about 200 km in the northern Dinarides and 280 km in the southern Dinarides, shallower than the SW Adria anomaly, which extends to at least 400 km depth.",

        "description": "This dataset is composed of the files required for simulating laboratory-scale injection of CO2-saturated water and HCl solution into cm-scale limestone samples. Six files required for simulating the CO2 injection experiment are included in the folder named CO2. The names of these files are as follows: \u201cCO2-input\u201d: input file read by the Crunchflow code and providing the necessary physical and chemical parameters needed for the simulation -these parameters mainly include time intervals, discretization, initial and boundary conditions, geochemical conditions-; \u201cdatabase\u201d: geochemical database for running the simulation; \u201c64bit-libiomp5md\u201d: A dynamic link library (DLL) required to run the Crunchflow code; \u201cPerm.in.x\u201d: permeability file in X direction for all grids; \u201cPerm.in.y\u201d: permeability file in Y direction for all grids; \u201cPerm.in.z\u201d: permeability file in Z direction for all grids. The same files for simulating the HCl injection experiment are included in the folder named HCl. This folder includes two input files \u201cHCl-input-1\u201d and \u201cHCl-input-2\u201d (instead of one) required for simulating the two stages of HCl solution injection into the limestone sample. To run the simulations, one needs to execute the Crunchflow executable file and enter the name of the input file, i.e., either \u201cCO2-input\u201d or \u201cHCl-input-1\u201d with the suffix \u201c.in\u201d in the command window and press enter. Note that in the HCl injection case, you only need to run the \u201cHCl-input-1\u201d file.

        "title": "Dataset - Nanoparticulated Bimodal Contrast Agent for Ultra-High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectral X-ray Computed Tomography",
        "description": "Bimodal medical imaging based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) is a well-known strategy to increase diagnostic accuracy. The most recent advances in MRI and CT instrumentation are related to the use of ultrahigh magnetic fields (UHF-MRI) and different working voltages (spectral CT), respectively. Such advances require the parallel development of bimodal contrast agents (CAs) that are efficient under the new instrumental conditions. In this work, we have synthesized, through a precipitation reaction from a glycerol solution of the precursors, uniform barium dysprosium fluoride nanospheres with cubic fluorite structure, whose size was found to depend on the Ba\/(Ba+Dy) ratio of the starting solution. Moreover, irrespective of the starting Ba\/(Ba+Dy) ratio, the experimental Ba\/(Ba+Dy) values were always lower than those used in the starting solutions. This result was assigned to a lower precipitation kinetics of barium fluoride compared to dysprosium fluoride, as inferred from the detailed analysis of the effect of reaction time on the chemical composition of the precipitates. A sample composed of 34 nm nanospheres with a Ba0.51Dy0.49F2.49 stoichiometry, showed a transversal relaxivity (r2) value of 147.11 mM-1\u00b7s-1 at 9.4 T and gave a high negative contrast in the phantom image. Likewise, it produced high X-ray attenuation in a large range of working voltages (from 80 KVp to 140 KVp), which can be attributed to the presence of different K-edge values, high Z elements (Ba and Dy) in the nanospheres. Finally, these nanospheres showed negligible cytotoxicity for different biocompatibility tests. Taken together, these results show that the reported nanoparticles (NPs) are excellent candidates as UHF MRI\/Spectral CT bimodal imaging CAs.",

        "description": "Mortar blocks with addition of recycled polyurethane fibers (PUF) were subjected to abrasion using an original pin-on-disk tribometer in order to investigate the kinetic parameters and emission mechanisms of fine and ultrafine aerosol nanoparticles and the effect of the fiber concentration on the mechanical, tribological, and triboemission properties. Three different samples, referred as A (20% substitution level), B (40%), and C (60%) and a reference sample (Ref.) were analyzed for this study. The abrasion was performed in an environment chamber with filtered air using a stationary alumina sphere, 20 mm in diameter, which was pressed against the rotating sample using a dead weight of 1.3 kg. The sliding speed was 1 m s-1. A quantitative methodology was employed to assess the deposition rate, particle size distribution, and emissivity. The triboemission properties were correlated with the pore structure, morphology and tribochemical transformations of the particles and worn surfaces. The specific surface area, distribution of micro- and mesopore sizes, and skeleton density were evaluated through a comprehensive analysis involving three distinct methods: dynamic water adsorption, N2 adsorption, and He pycnometry. The mechanically affected zones were characterized using white-light confocal microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The function of the particle size distribution exhibited two modes, with the most probable particle size falling within the range of 115-156 nm. Interestingly, the PUFs addition did not changed considerably the size of the particles. The aggregation of PUFs resulted in a gradual increase in the volume of pores, particularly mesopores, as well as an increase in the specific surface area. The study's results demonstrated a decline in the deposition rate of aerosol particles within the 10 to 60 nm aerodynamic diameter range as the concentration of PUFs increased. This observation strongly suggested the occurrence of direct emission of polymeric aerosol particles resulting from the abrasion of PUFs. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the intricate relationship between material composition, particle size distribution, porosity, and emission kinetics.",

Monoxide (i.e., FeO or CoO) has often been detected as a byproduct of the reduction, although it remains unclear whether the formation of this phase occurs during the reduction itself or at a later stage. Here, a novel reaction cell was designed to monitor the reduction in situ using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Sequential Rietveld refinements of the in situ data yielded time-resolved information on the sample composition and confirmed that the monoxide is generated as an intermediate phase. The macroscopic magnetic properties of samples at different reduction stages were measured by means of vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), revealing a magnetic softening with increasing soft phase content, which was too pronounced to be exclusively explained by the introduction of soft material in the system. The elemental compositions of the constituent phases were obtained from joint Rietveld refinements of ex situ high-resolution PXRD and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data. It was found that the alloy has a tendency to emerge in a Co-rich form, inducing a Co deficiency on the remaining spinel phase, which can explain the early softening of the magnetic material.",
