        "msl_description_abstract": "Production of oil and gas from sandstone reservoirs leads to small elastic and inelastic strains in the reservoir, which may induce surface subsidence and seismicity. While the elastic component is easily described, the inelastic component, and any rate-sensitivity thereof remain poorly understood in the relevant small strain range (≤ 1.0%). To address this, we performed a sequence of five stress/strain-cycling plus strain-marker-imaging experiments on a single split-cylinder sample (porosity 20.4%) of Slochteren sandstone from the seismogenic Groningen gas field. The tests were performed under in-situ conditions of effective confining pressure (40 MPa) and temperature (100°C), exploring increasingly large differential stresses (up to 75 MPa) and/or axial strains (up to 4.8%) in consecutive runs. At the small strains relevant to producing reservoirs (≤ 1.0%), inelastic deformation was largely accommodated by deformation of clay-filled grain contacts. High axial strains (>1.4%) led to pervasive intragranular cracking plus intergranular slip within localized, conjugate bands. Using a simplified sandstone model, we show that the magnitude of inelastic deformation produced in our experiments at small strains (≤ 1.0%) and stresses relevant to the Groningen reservoir can indeed be roughly accounted for by clay film deformation. Thus, inelastic compaction of the Groningen reservoir is expected to be largely governed by clay film deformation. Compaction by this mechanism is shown to be rate-insensitive on production time-scales, and is anticipated to halt when gas production stops. However, creep by other processes cannot be eliminated. Similar, clay-bearing sandstone reservoirs occur widespread globally, implying a wide relevance of our results.\n\nThe data is provided in a folder with 3 subfolders for 5 experiments/samples.

Submarine landscape and sediment distribution patterns are interpreted in terms of glaciomarine facies types that are related to variations in the past position of the glacier front. In particular, asymmetric ridges that form a curved entity and a large sill at the fjord mouth may represent moraines that depict at least two relatively stable positions of the ice front in the Disko Bay and at the fjord mouth. In this respect, Ilulissat Glacier shows prominent differences to the East Greenland Kangerlussuaq Glacier which is comparable in present size and present role for the ice discharge from the inland ice sheet. Two linear clusters of pockmarks in the center of the sedimentary basin seem to be linked to ongoing methane release due to dissociation of gas hydrates, a process fueled by climate warming in the Arctic realm.",

        "msl_description_abstract": "A ship-based acoustic mapping campaign was conducted at the exit of Ilulissat Ice Fjord and in the sedimentary basin of Disko Bay to the west of the fjord mouth. Submarine landscape and sediment distribution patterns are interpreted in terms of glaciomarine facies types that are related to variations in the past position of the glacier front. In particular, asymmetric ridges that form a curved entity and a large sill at the fjord mouth may represent moraines that depict at least two relatively stable positions of the ice front in the Disko Bay and at the fjord mouth. In this respect, Ilulissat Glacier shows prominent differences to the East Greenland Kangerlussuaq Glacier which is comparable in present size and present role for the ice discharge from the inland ice sheet. Two linear clusters of pockmarks in the center of the sedimentary basin seem to be linked to ongoing methane release due to dissociation of gas hydrates, a process fueled by climate warming in the Arctic realm.",

Submarine landscape and sediment distribution patterns are interpreted in terms of glaciomarine facies types that are related to variations in the past position of the glacier front. In particular, asymmetric ridges that form a curved entity and a large sill at the fjord mouth may represent moraines that depict at least two relatively stable positions of the ice front in the Disko Bay and at the fjord mouth. In this respect, Ilulissat Glacier shows prominent differences to the East Greenland Kangerlussuaq Glacier which is comparable in present size and present role for the ice discharge from the inland ice sheet. Two linear clusters of pockmarks in the center of the sedimentary basin seem to be linked to ongoing methane release due to dissociation of gas hydrates, a process fueled by climate warming in the Arctic realm.",

        "msl_description_abstract": "A ship-based acoustic mapping campaign was conducted at the exit of Ilulissat Ice Fjord and in the sedimentary basin of Disko Bay to the west of the fjord mouth. Submarine landscape and sediment distribution patterns are interpreted in terms of glaciomarine facies types that are related to variations in the past position of the glacier front. In particular, asymmetric ridges that form a curved entity and a large sill at the fjord mouth may represent moraines that depict at least two relatively stable positions of the ice front in the Disko Bay and at the fjord mouth. In this respect, Ilulissat Glacier shows prominent differences to the East Greenland Kangerlussuaq Glacier which is comparable in present size and present role for the ice discharge from the inland ice sheet. Two linear clusters of pockmarks in the center of the sedimentary basin seem to be linked to ongoing methane release due to dissociation of gas hydrates, a process fueled by climate warming in the Arctic realm.",

        "msl_description_abstract": "The National Gallery houses one of the greatest ‒ and most visited ‒ collections of Western European painting, often welcoming more than 6 million visitors a year. The Scientific Department researches the history of materials and techniques and their degradation mechanisms (fading, darkening, etc.), through analysis using a range of micro-analytical and imaging methods. It also works in the fields of preventive conservation and environmental management of galleries (monitoring, lighting, vibration), as well as the development of a wide range of new instruments and methods (both analytical and imaging) for technical examination of artworks, most often in collaboration with universities. The examination of the environmental conditions within The National Gallery began soon after it was established in 1824. Early concerns often related to dust and pollution. The first electronic data logger, recording light levels, was introduced in 1975, with the regular logging of temperature and relative humidity followed soon after. Today the Gallery has hundreds of sensors, monitoring the environmental conditions in over hundreds of locations, 24/7. The National Gallery currently archives millions of environmental readings every year, which are used to monitor the Gallery conditions ensuring the on-going care of the collections. These readings are also used to examine long term environmental trends, manage additional events, and within the planning and management of preventive conservation work and research at the National Gallery. The National Gallery Environmental Database is an internal, bespoke system which has been developed, over the last 20 years, to act as an archive for all of these environmental readings. This dataset contains a selected range of the data gathered from a few of the external sensors that have been used to monitor ambient light levels, temperature, relative humidity and air moisture content 24 hours a day, 7 days a week over the last two decades.",
